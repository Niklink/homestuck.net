New!

Fresh from the lab comes Midnight Crew themed cursors.
I did this because, although there IS a cursor pack out there, its not all that great and poorly packaged. (apologies to the author, but they were all .ani files, even the static ones, and a lot of them I couldn't really find an application for. Your selection was strange.)

Contained within:
3 Spades Pointers
Clubs Pointer
Diamonds Pointer
Hearts Pointer
Flashing text selection cursor
Spinning Clock busy animation
Dripping Blood busy animation

===Install===
To install, unzip and copy these six pointers into C:\Windows\Cursors, and then go to Control Panel\Mouse\Pointers and assign them with the Browse button for what curosr state you want them to be.

===Uninstall===
To uninstall, remove them from C:\Windows\Cursors and reassign them in the Pointers window mentioned in the install instructions.

===Credits===
Some props to Shadow of the Lotus, I used a little bit of your artwork, I hope you don't mind.
Some props to Andrew Hussie for some other artwork.
The rest of those props go to me for doing a fair bit by hand and making sure they all work.
