<h2>On the subject of audio reactions.</h2>
<p>Okay, so some people requested an audio react for Dave: Accelerate, and a couple of you even asked for a few pages after it! I wanted to know what you guys think I should do. I’ll admit that the whole audio reacting thing makes me kinda uncomfortable but I do want to try to see how it goes! Before telling me if you would rather have a written reaction or an audio one, consider this: it would be only audio (video size limitation on tumblr is 100 mb and I’m not creating a YouTube channel when I don’t even know if I will do it again!), there will be a transcript together with screenshots, and also as I have already said english is not my first language and so my pronunciation skills are… kinda shitty?? you would still have the transcript to read as I ramble off though. So yeah, let me know what you think about this! :)</p>
