<h2>END OF ACT 1.</h2>
<p>I was planning to make a post in which I shared my thoughts and a bit of speculations (mostly on characters) when I got to the end of Act 1. The most of it is already in my drafts but I have to reread what is already there and add things regarding the latest developments. Plus, I cannot concentrate right now. Like, not at all. The urge to start reading Act 2 is TOO STRONG. I know John is almost surely alive, but is that <b>almost</b> that throws me off. I need to know. I&rsquo;m getting attached, I fear I&rsquo;m experiencing a case of the so-called &ldquo;feels&rdquo;. Run while you can. <i><b>Save yourself.</b></i></p>
