<blockquote>	
			Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A
 number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of 
INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to 
program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness 
for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like
 to play GAMES sometimes.
<br/>


What will you do?

			<br/></blockquote><p>Which summed up would be:</p><p>Your name is JOHN and you are a big nerd. Alright, jokes aside. Well, admitting they are terrible is already something. Oh God, I spot Con Air (hey, Nicolas Cage. Every movie with Nicolas Cage in it is cool) and Ghostbusters??! What&rsquo;s wrong with Ghostbusters? I don&rsquo;t understand. What&rsquo;s the other one? I&rsquo;ve not watched Con Air in <i>years</i>.</p><p>But PARANORMAL LORE? i totally approve, kid.</p><p>Several cakes? Isn&rsquo;t one enough? Plus, it&rsquo;s your birthday, John. You&rsquo;re supposed to be throwing a party, not standing in your room all alone doing nothing.<br/></p>
