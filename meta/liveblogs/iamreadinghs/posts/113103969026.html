<h2>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</h2>
<p>Am I going to regret posting this? Most certainly.</p><p>Will I post it anyway? But OF COURSE.</p><p>So I think I will have to close the inbox for a couple of days or more in order to catch up with the messages, and since I will be replying to EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, before closing it I thought it was time to do something I have wanted to do for a while. I must confess that I am kind of really self-conscious when I write. I am always asking myself if I am commenting too much, too little, if that one pun was too awful to post (yes, I&rsquo;m being serious), if I am boring you, if I insert too many gifs, not enough gifs, etc etc&hellip; later on I <i>have</i> been receiving asks that told me to change something. And I wondered if others had opinions about it as well but chose not to share.</p><p>Sooo, I am openly asking you to tell me what you like of this liveblog so far, and what you DON&rsquo;T like. If you would like to see more of something, or less of something else TELL ME. If you prefer long posts or short ones&hellip; Seriously, GO WILD. Any kind of feedback is appreciated. You could tell me to make post titles sound sillier. I WILL TAKE NOTE OF IT.</p><p>Things you cannot ask me: USE CAPS LOCK LESS. I&rsquo;M SORRY, IT IS PART OF MY BEING, YOU WOULD BE ASKING ME TO BETRAY MY OWN IDENTITY AND I WOULD REPLY WITH A RANT WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN CAPS LOCK— I am kidding. If you have trouble reading what I write when I use it, feel free to make me know. I will try try to use it only when it is <b>extremely necessary.</b> Otherwise I will bold the words like I just did.</p><p>Things you cannot ask me: Read faster, post faster, reply faster (well, I don&rsquo;t blame you for the last one but STILL) I liveblog and reply whenever I have time and feel like it. </p><p>Okay, I think I have said everything I needed to say. Your turn to speak now!</p>
