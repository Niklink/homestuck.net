<h2>You might want to get someone to filter asks and such so you don't get everything spoiled for you, it's a pretty likely thing</h2>
<p>Actually, I already have someone who filters asks for me! :) Same person who made me start liveblogging Homestuck! I gave him the password, he checks the inbox and tells me when it is safe to go and reply to asks!  I’m also forbidden from going through the notifications, there are apparently spoilery icons, addictions to posts and even urls. He makes it sound like if I look at the activity section I could get the whole thing spoiled for me. I don’t know how that is even possible. (¬_¬)</p>
