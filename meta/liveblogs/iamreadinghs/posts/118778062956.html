<h2>On the subject of audio reactions.</h2>
<p><a href="http://iamreadinghs.tumblr.com/post/118394957866/on-the-subject-of-audio-reactions" class="tumblr_blog">iamreadinghs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Okay, so some people requested an audio react for Dave: Accelerate, and a couple of you even asked for a few pages after it! I wanted to know what you guys think I should do. I’ll admit that the whole audio reacting thing makes me kinda uncomfortable but I do want to try to see how it goes! Before telling me if you would rather have a written reaction or an audio one, consider this: it would be only audio (video size limitation on tumblr is 100 mb and I’m not creating a YouTube channel when I don’t even know if I will do it again!), there will be a transcript together with screenshots, and also as I have already said english is not my first language and so my pronunciation skills are… kinda shitty?? you would still have the transcript to read as I ramble off though. So yeah, let me know what you think about this! :)</p></blockquote>

<p>LIVEBLOGGING STATUS UPDATE!!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="514" data-orig-width="630"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_no8k9ikYkj1tny94s_1280.png" data-orig-height="514" data-orig-width="630"/></figure><p>HERE I AM! I am looking at the fourth wall!! Like how much more meta can we even get?! :D Anyway, what I meant to do was informing you about my audio-react shenanigans. I opted for an audio react for Jack: Ascend instead of one for Dave: Accelerate. Well, I didn’t exactly “opt” for it. It was kind of forced because I must have messed up with some settings and basically during the latter the music is really loud even though I set the volume very low and you can’t hear what I’m saying. Not that you would have lost much. It was just me laughing at Calsprite. &hellip;For about three minutes. Non-stop. </p><p>ANYWAY. I want to know if you want the audio reaction for Jack: Ascend or just a transcript. Because it’s just me screaming HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT over and over and progressively louder. I’m not kidding. That’s all I say. I meant scream. That’s all I scream. During the flash. (I reached octaves I did not know I could reach. I’m not even sure the human ear can listen to it. Maybe dolphins can. I doubt there are dolphins reading my liveblog.) Then I make some considerations before and after. But during the thing&hellip; That’s all I do. If you want me to upload it anyway I take no responsibilities for your poor poor ears. I just freaked out a tiny little bit. </p><p>I don’t want to stop at Jack: Ascend for the next update though. Wanna liveblog at least another&hellip; 20-30 pages?? I’ve been kind of really busy this weekend. Between studying for tests and crying about John and Jade’s death. You know, things like that. And probably too much time spent watching anime. (GIVE PSYCHO-PASS A TRY, IT’S SO GOOD.) &hellip;Putting things in parenthesis doesn’t really make sense if you write in all caps into them, does it now? Okay, that’s all I wanted to say, have a nice day y’all!</p>
