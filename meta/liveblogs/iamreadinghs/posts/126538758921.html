<h2>Alternia confirmed for gigantic and elaborate Jade parallel.</h2>
<p>A quick summary: Gamzee is rapidly growing on me, Terezi is AWESOME SUPER AWESOME AWESOME, AC is the embodiment of all those tumblr posts in which people wish they could be adorable and cut some bitches at the same time, <i>and please for the love of all that’s holy someone stop Karkat</i></p><p>NOW WHERE WAS I AT</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="445" data-orig-width="644"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_nszdxbH2vN1tny94s_1280.png" data-orig-height="445" data-orig-width="644" alt="image"/></figure><p>I actually spent some time on this. I&rsquo;m not saying how much. If I had to choose for a title for my own Sburb Land it would be something along the lines of Land of Lost Time and Bullshittery&hellip;&hellip; which doesn&rsquo;t even fit the titles patterns FUCK</p><p>But screw it, look at Gamzee&hellip;.That stance. Such grace&hellip;. Such concentration, those half lidded eyes&hellip;. That half open mouth&hellip;. bared teeth&hellip;. Go get some sleep&hellip;&hellip;..</p><p>What? I&rsquo;m just extremely concerned about those kids&rsquo; sleeping schedules&hellip;&hellip;.. Look at those bags under their eyes, well Gamzee is the only one so far that doesn&rsquo;t have them but it has also been implied that he eats raw soporific at every meal. Well, not raw. He bakes it.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="61" data-orig-width="597"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_nszefgWuXU1tny94s_1280.png" data-orig-height="61" data-orig-width="597" alt="image"/></figure><p>

I HAVE SUCH A GREAT TIMING FOR MENTIONING AWFUL THINGS

<p>It is still piping hot but you can&rsquo;t help yourself. You sneak a taste of the SOPOR SLIME PIE. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>You aren&rsquo;t supposed to eat that slime. It does funny things to a troll&rsquo;s head. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>But you were never taught that on account of a lousy upbringing. Your custodian was always out to sea. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>That is where he is now. Maybe you will go outside and see if you can spot him.</p>

<div>???????¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿????</div>

<div> </div>

<div>WHO IS THIS ASSHOLE</div>

<div> </div>

<div>WHO LETS HIS KID POSSIBLY WRECK THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM ON A DAILY BASIS WITHOUT BATTING AN EYELASH</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I&rsquo;M GONNA FUCKING FIGHT HIM</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I COULDN&rsquo;T FIGHT BRO BECAUSE HE IS PROBABLY FUCKING INDESTRUCTIBLE OR SOME SHIT OKAY</div>

<div> </div>

<div>BUT I WILL FIGHT THIS ONE</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I WILL AVENGE ALL THE KIDS WHO GREW UP IN SHITTY HOUSEHOLDS</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I PROMISE</div>

<div> </div>

<div>I will give the benefit of the doubt to Karkat for not telling him to quit it because he doesn&rsquo;t even seem to know. But if he does know&hellip;. and yet he does not tell his friend to stop eating that thing&hellip;. let&rsquo;s just say I won&rsquo;t be pleased.</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02018_2.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div>You grab a JUGGLING CLUB. You&rsquo;ll need it if you are going to go out. It is dangerous to leave unarmed.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>ARE WE DRAWING A PARALLEL TO JADE??? YES WE FREAKING ARE AND HE PRACTICALLY RAISED HIMSELF</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Grandpa was always away on his journeys and Gamzee&rsquo;s guardian is always out to the sea. A quick PSA: don&rsquo;t fucking take upon yourself to raise babies that you find mysteriously abandoned in craters if you plan on staying out of the house 80% of the time.</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02018_1.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>Does he use the clubs to stage a little funny clown jig or does he clubs them repetitively till they bite the big one?? Those are the questions. He doesn&rsquo;t really seem a &ldquo;violent&rdquo; person but then again neither did Jade. Or John.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Never stop to think about how violent those 13 y/o can get in combat  because if you do you will realize that sweet young John fucking sMASHES SKULLS WITH HIS HAMMER MERCILESSLY and you will regret that.  :)</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Rose used to be the most violent. Then she switched to majiick. But if you think about it  she still incinerates her enemies while screaming things like &ldquo;WELCOME TO THE PARTY MOTHERFUCKERS&rdquo;. Yikes!</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02019_2.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>You leave your hive and head out to the beach. There is no sign of your custodian. </div>

<div> </div>

<div>IS HE EVEN ALIVE I AM BEGINNING TO BE DUBIOUS</div>

<div> </div>

<div>You should not stay out here very long. The SEA DWELLERS are quite hostile.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>HOW INCREDIBLY NOT FUCKING OMINOUS X314 COMBO</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Everything is fucking creepy in a way or another on this effing planet I swear</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02019_1.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>Why is there a yellow umbrella on his roof. So many questions. Is he organizing a beach party on there&hellip;? &hellip;.alone&hellip;&hellip;. Didn&rsquo;t Jade organize tea parties next to the big fireplace in the grand foyer? With the fucking dolls?? Or was it grandpa back in the days&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; But look, the moral of the story is don&rsquo;t fucking talk to puppets because sometimes they talk back to you. And then you snap. I redirect you to Dave and Bro Strider for further details.</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02020.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>THEEEEEREE SHE ISSSSS</div>

<div> </div>

<div>THERE SHE FREAKING ISSS</div>

<div> </div>

<div>AYYYYY TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO SHOW UP YOUNG LADY</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Someone is bugging you. This is exciting. You&rsquo;re always down for shooting the wicked shit with anyone that who&rsquo;ll put up with you. </div>

<div> </div>

<div>That&rsquo;s&hellip;.. the way you worded that&hellip;&hellip; is really sad. I mean&hellip; He is not unpleasant or overbearing or anything that may push people away. He is a nice kid. He shouldn&rsquo;t have that sort of mentality&hellip;. But I guess that&rsquo;s the sort of thing you get from talking to assholes everyday&hellip;. Not mentioning names&hellip;..</div>

<div> </div>

<div>Now if only you could figure out how to get your HUSKTOP out of this stupid thing. It&rsquo;ll be a miracle if you can manage.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS WHERE THE MODUS&rsquo; NAME CAME FROM</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02021_1.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>Unsure if he is praying the juggalos or trying to summon a horrorterrOR OH SHIT THEY ARE IN THE BACKGROUND THEY ARE IN— WHY MUST THEY BE SO CREEPY. No, not the horrorterrors, <em>the juggalos.</em></div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02021_3.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>You say a short prayer to your beloved MIRTHFUL MESSIAHS, and splash a pinch of SPECIAL STARDUST in your face.</div>

<div> </div>

<div>And now!!! Second star to the right, and straight on till morning!!! &hellip;..What do you mean it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> kind of stardust and he isn&rsquo;t gonna take flight and reach his Mythical Paradise Planet.</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02022_1.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02022_2.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>OH MY GOD. Some help they were! But I suppose that&rsquo;s what you sign up for when you worship two clowns. He is gonna get chewed up by a sea creature for littering! Quick, back to the house, Gamzee!!!</div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02023_1.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div><img src="../media/02023_2.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<div> </div>

<div>You wonder if you can just&hellip; <br style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>Just sort of reach over&hellip; <br style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>And&hellip;</div>

<div> </div>

<div>This is a strong message to young readers, you see. The miracle that you were desperately waiting for was in yourself all along, you only needed to believe in yourself no matter what.  JUST DO IT!! </div>

<div> </div>

<div>A miracle is also whatever the fuck his left arm is doing. Seriously that&rsquo;s not how articulations work. Unless Faygo makes your articulations all jelly. That&rsquo;s a possibility.</div>

<div> </div>

<p>OKAY BUT WHY IS HE NOT LOOKING AT THE SCREEN I&rsquo;M LAUGHING</p>

<p>How is he actually writing?? And what is he staring so pointedly at?? Who is there?? He looks at peace with the whole universe. Is he channeling his inner chakra? Connecting with his juggalos self? Who knows.</p>

<p>GC: NO WOND3R V4NT4S C4NT ST4ND YOU </p>

<p>Five points to GC!!! Miss Seer of Mind strikes again! That is indeed the reason why Mister Vantas is so annoyed by Gamzee. Karkat is especially irked by people he cannot get a reaction out of when insulting them. We&rsquo;ve had a precedent&hellip;&hellip; Strangely enough he is way happier with himself if you do insult him back. &hellip;I&rsquo;m starting to suspect that he actually enjoys being angry&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>THIS CONVERSATION IS A WRECK JUST LIKE ITS PARTICIPANTS</p>

<p>Okay but he gets sidetracked more easily than Dave when you put him in front of plushie rumps so I really don&rsquo;t envy the one who will end up being their coplayer&hellip;. *looks pointedly at GC* I reaaaally don&rsquo;t envy that mysterious person.</p>

<p>But for nowwww&hellip;. Time to meet h—</p>

<p>UUUUUUGHHHHHHH</p>

<p>What is up with Karkat&rsquo;s fixation with getting things done? Relax, dude. Take it easy. Build some pillow fortresses, stage the climax of your favorite movie, spend time fantasizing about your romantic escapades with Liv Tyler, gently caress your Will Smith posters&hellip;. seriously, if I have to agonize over watching you do completely unimportant things at least let them be adorable things. You will never reach Cinnamon Roll Status with that attitude. you have the looks, but it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside that matters the most.</p>

<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; line-height: 1.428571em; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Droid Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><img src="../media/02025_2.gif" alt="image"/></div>

<p>Karkat is&hellip;.. Preparing himself to teleport to another universe&hellip;.? Teleporting WITH the universe? Into Sburb?? Creating the fucking Rift???? Which we still don&rsquo;t know if to capitalize because nobody fucking bothered asking??? I have no effing idea.</p>

<p>Umh. Alternatively he is just setting up things for his journey to the afterlife. I can&rsquo;t read this crap, sorry.</p>

<p>Finally some peace and quiet. Now you can bear down on your coding. This will surely last all evening, without interruption. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>You reopen one of your ~ATH projects you started recently. You are still horsing around with the conditions for terminating the loops. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>What many ~ATH coders do is import finite constructs and bind the loops to their lifespan. For instance the main loop here will terminate on the death of the universe, labeled U. That way you only have to wait billions of years for it to end instead of forever. </p>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s&hellip;. convenient, I guess?? It&rsquo;s not like you could tell the difference you won&rsquo;t be around that long. Doesn&rsquo;t that make Snowman basically immortal though?! Two billion years is just too much, after a while you just get bored of standing around being badass. Especially if you have to deal with people like Slick everyday.</p>

<p>Your hacker buddy is obnoxiously good at it. He&rsquo;s sent you some files which you still don&rsquo;t understand, but you&rsquo;re not going to admit that. He is even better at making viruses than you, which really gets stuck in your nook.</p>

<p>YEAH KARKAT BUT WHAT <em>IS</em> A NOOK?? <em>WHAT IS IT???</em></p>

<p>The one true Ultimate Riddle.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02026.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>We are importing&hellip;. two other universes? And also there is a lot of dying going on. What the heck is this code even. Something happens when the universes die?? The tilde is a destructor so when the first universe is destroyed EVERYTHING <em>BUT</em> the second one also is (because the exclamation point is like putting a negative before it)?? BUT BUT BUT the braces stand for &ldquo;if&rdquo; so. Hmm. THEREFORE.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Yes I am definitely not googling this as I go along and I am an expert in programming.</p>

<p>HMMM. When the two first events unfold something happens in the first universe that makes the first one die wait weren&rsquo;t the universes dead already??? Maybe this is the description of how it happens?? So IF this something happens in the first universe, the second one is destroyed, but as that happens something happening in the second universe kills the first one?? Wouldn&rsquo;t that require simultaneity?? And on another note, a totally unrelated question for TA: <em>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE</em></p>

<p>This code, when executed, immediately causes the user&rsquo;s computer to explode, and places a curse on the user forever, along with everyone he knows, and everyone he&rsquo;ll ever meet. </p>

<p>?????????? I FUCKING GUVR UP. I WAS TRYING TO FUVKING DECIFER THAT YPU ASSHOLES</p>

<p>Where the FUCK was THIS written. This code is absolutely fucking useless. You can&rsquo;t even send it to people who you hate because you would be fucking cursed as well. Unless you are aiming to damage someone anonymously and you are an international spy or something. Does TA work as an international spy for Alternia? Kid is suspicious. You know who is suspicious also?? AA. You don&rsquo;t go around with a chumhandle like that and expect me to trust you.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, later on you would run this code in a fit of stupidity.</p>

<p>OH FOR THE LOVE OF JUGGALOS HEAVEN</p>

<p>NOT EVEN ACCIDENTALLY</p>

<p>IT WASN&rsquo;T EVEN AN ACCIDENT</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know how he does stuff like this. What does this even mean? It&rsquo;s nonsense. Is it even syntactically viable?? Are you allowed to color text like that??? ARGH.</p>

<p>You can if you are cool enough, Karkat.</p>

<p>Oh speak of the devil. Here he is bugging you about something. Time to put on your game face and pretend you don&rsquo;t think very highly of his abilities.</p>

<p>I-it&rsquo;s not like he admires you or anything, b-baka&hellip;.</p>

Jokes aside, having good people skills is not the only thing, crazily enough you also need someone like Karkat with a certain drive and sense of responsibility.

TA and GC are gonna team up together. GC didn&rsquo;t want to in the beginning but after Karkat managed to almost break her auricular sponge clots for the third time she just gave up. They gave everybody but Karkat the chaptas for some cool jetpacks and hacked his gates so that he is stuck on his planet. Every once in a while they will fly over his head and he will shake his tiny fists in the air while swearing like it&rsquo;s the last thing he will do. They will just give him double middle fingers from the sky.</p>

<p>Listen, TA is an adorable little nerd, but<em> please</em> don&rsquo;t make him talk to Karkat ever again. I was mentally scarred by this pesterlog.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02028.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Sounds like someone downstairs is getting pretty crabby. This is not an encounter you are looking forward to. You&rsquo;ll probably put it off as long as you can manage.</p>

<p>That is so not Karkat&rsquo;s guardian in there, that&rsquo;s for sure. Sounds more like someone he is begrudgingly tending to, to be honest. Could be a pet, could be the crab we have seen before? That would make the use of the word crabby the most awful pun I have ever read. But it has been aptly demonstrated that kids can&rsquo;t have a pet <em>and</em> a guardian. Unless one of them iS DEAD— KARKAT. KARKAT VANTAS PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE NOT ALSO AN ORPHAN WHAT THE FUCK.</p>

<p>WELL. Given that he is going to prototype a crab and he lives nowhere near Gamzee or the sea, I&rsquo;m just going to say that this is an elaborate Jade parallel and the crab lives in the house, (alien crabs apparently grumble) that Karkat was abandoned on the shore when he was very little and a bunch of empathetic hermit crabs took it upon themselves to make him grow up strong and healthy (and crabby)!!!! This is a very serious theory, no but seriously what&rsquo;s up with this, I need to know. </p>

<p><img src="../media/02029.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>PLEASE BE GC&rsquo;S HIVE PLEASE BE GC&rsquo;S HIVE PLEASE BE GC&rsquo;S HIVE PLEASE BE GC&rsquo;S HIVE</p>

<p>BINGOOOOOO</p>

<p>YOOO YOOOOOOO</p>

<p>ARE THOSE DRAGONS</p>

<p><img src="../media/02031.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Standing in this room for extended periods of time could probably permanently blind you if you are not careful of the strong colors, but GC doesn&rsquo;t have this sort of problems now, does she? Though she can SMELL colors, so she made this place as fun as possible for herself, it&rsquo;s not a room, IT&rsquo;S AN EXPERIENCE. I just hope she doesn&rsquo;t feel dizzy after a while??</p>

<p>There are serious looking books everywhere! Not even there just for display, they must have been recently sniffed, since some are standing on the ground. Also either there is rope on the ground, or &hellip;&hellip;it is the outline of a freshly discovered body on a crime scene. &hellip;&hellip;Girl, we&rsquo;ve dubbed your murders as accidental so far, don&rsquo;t disappoint me!</p>

<p>ALSO ALSO calling it right now that she eats the pages to read</p>

<p>Your name is TEREZI PYROPE.</p>

<p>Hello, Terezi!!! Yours is a very interesting last name, but we will get to that later, alright??</p>

<p>You are pretty enthusiastic about dragons.</p>

<p>I WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED BUT THIS IS STILL THE BEST WAY TO OPEN A INTRODUCTION EVER</p>

<p>But you have a PARTICULAR AFFECTION for their COLORFUL SCALES, which you gather and use to decorate your hive.</p>

<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">ARE THOSE THE SCALES OF ACTUAL REAL LIVING DRAGONS OR ARE THEY FAKE PLEASE THIS IS IMPORTANT</p>

<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Though you live alone, deep in the woods, you surround yourself with a variety of plushie pals known as SCALEMATES. You often spend your days with them in rounds of LIVE ACTION ROLE PLAYING.</p>

<p>*whispers* YOU ABSOLUTE NERD<br/>
Okay I shouted it, I was lying. She would so get along with Grandpa and Bro. They are right up her alley.</p>

<p>You used to engage in various forms of MORE EXTREME ROLEPLAYING with some of your other friends before you had an accident. </p>

<p>*swiftly files this accident under things that <em>absolutely</em> won&rsquo;t be brought up again nor have any sort of relevance*</p>

<p>She played hardcore real life game sessions of Dungeons&amp;Dragons that would last for days and she played as a dragon, and wielded a sword and fuck the losers who said that dragons cannot wield swords!!! (That is to say, GA, stop being so nitpicky, gosh)</p>

<p>You take an interest in justice, holding particular fascination for ORCHESTRATING THE DEMISE OF THE WICKED. You have taken up study of BRUTAL ALTERNIAN LAW, and surround yourself with legal books.</p>

<p>I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING BUT I DIDN&rsquo;T</p>

<p>WAIT DAMMIT</p>

<p>JUSTICE IS BLIND</p>

<p>LADY JUSTICE, LIBRA, SCALES, GALLOWS</p>

<p>You have no need for copies printed in TROLLBRAILLE, because you can SMELL AND TASTE THE WORDS. You hope one day to join the honorable ranks of the LEGISLACERATORS.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lawyer that also slays!!! It sooo fits her! She easily tricks people, knows her way around words, she is well-versed in psychology, therefore she would be versed in criminology too, and slays people just fine, I bet. That&rsquo;s the perfect job, too bad Sburb had to ruin it for her. So far we have a threshecutioner, a legislacerator, did Gamzee say anything?? I don&rsquo;t think so. Honestly I think he just doesn&rsquo;t have anything planned. Gotta be chill, you know? Thinking about the future is not motherfucking chill now, is it? He just wants to stay true to himself. &ldquo;I DiDn&rsquo;t cHoOsE ThE JuGgAlO LiFe, ThE JuGgAlO LiFe cHoSe mE&rdquo; GODDAMMIT HOW DOES HE WRITE LIKE THIS. IT TAKES HOURS.</p>

<p>Your trolltag is gallowsCalibrator and you SP34K W1TH TH3 NUM3R4LS TH3 BL1ND PROPH3TS ONC3 US3D. </p>

<p>Girl, that&rsquo;s just John&rsquo;s birthday. Wait. I just realized that John has been killed <em>on the day of his birthday</em>— <em>TEREZI!!!!</em> &hellip;&hellip;.I&rsquo;m sorry, sometimes the alternate timeline feelings just&hellip; resurface&hellip;..</p>

<p>Okay but seriously. SERIOUSLY. Why would some prophets care about 4/13?? Unless John is secretly the next Messiah (which he is not) I will say that it is something that regards Earth. And I will say that it is something that regards the day in which Earth started existing. Do I need to say anything else??</p>

<p>You are presently the leader of the RED TEAM, poised to begin a mysterious game with 5 other friends, in direct competition with another 6 of your friends, comprising the BLUE TEAM. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what you like to THINK</p>

<p>Meanwhile Karkat has gathered all the data of Terezi&rsquo;s last year adventures in FLARP. Every fucking game session. He has all of the statistics organized neatly. Every victory but most importantly every LOSS and MISTAKE, every time she fucked up on a strategic move. There are graphs. He has made a freaking power point. 101 REASONS WHY TEREZI PYROPE SHOULD NOT BE THE LEADER BUT IT SHOULD BE ME INSTEAD BECAUSE I WAS BORN AND HATCHED FOR THIS SOLE PURPOSE AND THE POSITION UNQUESTIONABLY BELONGS TO ME </p>

<p>tl;dr: FUCK OFF PYROPE</p>

<p>​What will you do?</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003932" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">Terezi: Cut to the chase and begin LARPing immediately. </a></p>

<p>​​I don&rsquo;t know what I expected. Wait&hellip; LARP is live action role play&hellip;. FLARP is??? fffffantasy live action role play?? Fun?? <em>FUCKING </em>LIVE ACTION ROLE PLAY!! Run for your lives, fuckers!! OH GODNESS!! FATAL live action role play!!!</p>

<p>Terezi, spill the beans!!! We all know of that night, long ago, getting rid of that body deep in the woods!! &ldquo;1T W4S 4 C4SU4LTY&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;NO ON3 MUST KNOW&rdquo; you said. Well now we know!</p>

<p><img src="../media/02032.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re heading straight to Courtroom Drama Land and as a proud Ace Attorney fan I&rsquo;m SUPER UP FOR IT</p>

<p>HIS HONORABLE TYRANNY<br/>
I bet his verdicts are so wise and just.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard to live action role play when there is no one who is alive nearby.</p>

<p>Awwww. That must suc—</p>

<p>But all of your Scalemates are alive to you. </p>

<p>SO. How hard did you hit your head during this so called accident of your—</p>

<p>At least you pretend to believe that to annoy people. </p>

<p>I LIKE YOU AND I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK</p>

<p><em>A LOT</em></p>

<p>You prepare a new campaign for one of your favorite scenarios, COURTBLOCK DRAMA.</p>

<p>OH DEAR. It is as I feared. So Terezi, give us the full debrief! Lay it down for us!</p>

<p>His HONORABLE TYRANNY presides. On trial is an especially detestable fellow, SENATOR LEMONSNOUT. You have sparred with this scumbag before. Tonight he faces justice. </p>

<p>Holy shit. What did the yellow bastard do??? It is the yellow one right??</p>

<p>You will play the role of the prosecuting attorney. On Alternia, there is no such thing as a defense attorney, or a defense. In a courtblock, the word defense itself is offensive.</p>

<p>Umh. Now not to be a killjoy or anything, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem that the presence of an attorney is really needed after all, you&rsquo;re just doing your little jig before they get executed, Terezi. It is&hellip; just a formality&hellip; so that Alternia doesn&rsquo;t face controversy and everything goes smooth as they kill whoever they please. &hellip;. Sorry?? Maybe I&rsquo;m TOTALLY WRONG but that&rsquo;s definitely the vibe I&rsquo;m getting.</p>

<p>Terezi: Interrogate.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02033.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>INTERROGATE MEANS <em>TALKING</em></p>

<p>WHATEVER YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING WITH THAT CANE I SUGGEST YOU DROP IT IMMEDIATELY OR THE ONLY WORDS YOU WILL BE HEARING ARE THE AGONIZING SCREAMS OF LEMONSNOUT</p>

<p>​Most of the interrogation is in the intimidating silence.</p>

<p>I THOUGHT SO—</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003936" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">Terezi: Slap him around a bit. </a></p>

<p><strong><em>TEREZI</em></strong></p>

<p>THIS IS ANIMAL CRUELTY YOU ARE NOT A TRUE DRAGON LOVER!!!!</p>

<p><img src="../media/02036.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>That scalemate must be made of fucking marble if it made Terezi&rsquo;s arm bend like that. Either that or troll&rsquo;s limbs have retractile bones that turn into tentacles at necessity. Very useful when you gotta retrieve something that fell behind the furniture. But not when you are slapping someone.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02037.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>SHE LOOKS SO SERIOUS WHAT A CUTE BIG FUCKING NERD</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want to slap too hard. Enough to sting, but not to bruise. It must be methodical, business-like. And persistent. You only stop when you smell tears.</p>

<p>Turns out that those tears were her own all along from that one time she had that nasty nightmare while hugging Mr Senator WAIT. Where does she sleep?? There was no recuperacoon in her room! Doesn&rsquo;t she sleep at all?? No wonder she is so snappy, she is on the verge of exhaustion OH MY GOD I KNOW</p>

<p>I KNOW WHY SHE DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE A RECUPERACOON<br/>
I KNOW<br/>
BECAUSE&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;WAIT FOR IT&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>BECAUSE JUSTICE NEVER SLEEPS!!! HA!! HA HA HA!!!!!!&hellip;&hellip;HA!&hellip;&hellip;HA??&hellip;.. WHY AREN&rsquo;T YOU LAUGHING??!!?</p>

<p>oh dear sweet heaven</p>

<p>Did you honestly think you could dip your corpulent snout into the imperial beetle coffers like that and get away with it?? Did you think your revolting abuse of the public trust would go unnoticed??? THINK AGAIN, GOOD SENATOR. WHILE THE PROSECUTION MAY BE BLIND, REST ASSURED THE LEAGUE OF LEGISLACERATORS SEES ALL.</p>

<p>I JUST FELT THE EXACT SAME TWINGE OF ANNOYANCE OF WHEN I GET RICKROLLED</p>

<p>WELL<br/>
This was a relatively short trip into the foreign.<br/>
Like really short.</p>

<p>And Terezi breaks and smashes the Fourth Wall only so that she can call me a dummy. Typical Pyrope. <s>What do you mean I have only been knowing her for twelve pages so I don&rsquo;t know what is typical of her???</s> She will however have to stand in line, as Jade is still there from after her last affront, I don&rsquo;t think there will be much to kick after she is done and finished.</p>

<p>ALSO how was I supposed to know that I would have needed to return to this very panel at some point later on??? I thought I needed to deduce the password on the spot! So mind your fucking manners!</p>



<p>See you later, you sweet mysterious path that could or could not potentially be an alternate timeline. I guess next time we won&rsquo;t be calling a witness? &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br/>

<p>PAGE 9135</p>

<p>THAT IS NOT A PAGE THAT REDIRECTS YOU SOMEWHERE WHEN YOU INSERT THE RIGHT PASSWORD</p>

<p>THAT IS PAGE 9135 AS I STARE AT THE UNNERVING LIBRA SIGN I&rsquo;M ON PAGE 9135 WITH ONLY A BUNCH OF UNKNOWN LETTERS AND OR NUMBERS SEPARATING MYSELF FROM IT. IT IS A PASSWORD PROTECTED PAGE. ONLY ONE PAGE. TECHNICALLY I COULD FUCKING TYPE IN THE ADDRESS OF PAGE 9136 AND SEE WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON 5000 PAGES AWAY AND I JUST??? FIND IT RIDICULOUS??? BUT THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IS THAT 5000 PAGES FROM NOW I WILL FUCKING NEED TO GO BACK TO THIS POINT AND WATCH TEREZI FUCK AROUND WITH PUPPETS DRAGONS ONCE AGAIN??? BECAUSE???? BECAUSE?????????? HOW IS THIS RELEVANT??? WHY IS THIS RELEVANT??? HOW CAN THIS BE RELEVANT TO THE STORY 5000 PAGES FROM THIS POINT??? WHY IS EVERYTHING RELEVANT??? WHAT AM I EVEN READING???</p>

<p>And it was worth a try. And maybe the other thirteen that I made after.<br/>
This is going to haunt me.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02039.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>WE CAN&rsquo;T LOOK AWAY ONE FUCKING SECOND I SWEAR</p>

<p>TRAGEDY</p>

<p>MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE FLEE, SOME SCREAM</p>

<p>HIS TYRANNY SHOUTS &ldquo;ORDER IN THE COURT!!&rdquo; THEN HE GOES BACK TO NAPPING— WAIT, WHAT?? NAPPING?? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING!! HE WAS PAYING FULL ATTENTION TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF COURSE</p>

<p>WELP TEREZI, SWEETIE, I THINK WE&rsquo;RE NOT GOING TO CALL THE WITNESS EITHER WAY, WHAT TO DO</p>

<p>Also please do stop and realize that this was staged by Terezi beforehand and she stabbed that poor little dragon and also the blood looks very suspiciously similar to the material of her red curtains by the door, then she positioned the scalemate behind her so that she could turn and gasp dramatically at the freshly discovered body and she did all of this because <em>she is an utter dork</em>. No other reasons. That&rsquo;s it. She is a DORK.</p>

<p>Oh, well played, Lemonsnout. Well played. The prosecution&rsquo;s key witness, murdered. How convenient! The courtblock has little choice but to acknowledge your cunning. You have earned just a teensy sliver of your respect back. For now. </p>

<p>I SHOULD HOPE THAT AS A FELLOW PROSECUTOR YOU DON&rsquo;T THINK THAT KILLING EARNS PEOPLE RESPECT</p>

<p>And no matter the plot twist the password page did interrupt the momentum!!</p>

<p><img src="../media/02040.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>SHE NEVER SAW IT COMING</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Sorry.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02041_1.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p><img src="../media/02041_2.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>The prosecution begs your pardon, dear senator, but you appear to have dropped something. A personal satchel, perhaps? CHOCK FULL OF ILLICIT, EMBEZZLED BEETLES, WITH WHICH YOU HAVE THE UNMITIGATED CHEEK TO WALTZ BEFORE HIS TYRANNY, CONCEALED BENEATH YOUR ILL-GOTTEN FINERY?????? </p>

<p>Okay, but realistically speaking Lemonsnout is a FUCKING IDIOT. </p>

<p>TEREZI THAT WAS REALLY REALLY CONVENIENT I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT</p>

<p>The prosecution requests a short recess from His Honorable Tyranny so that all law abiding and Mother Grub fearing citizens may go outside and puke.</p>

<p>OH MY FUCKIN—<br/>
EXCELLENTLY DELIVERED LINE<br/>
EXECUTION 10/10<br/>
PROSECUTOR IS A DRAMA QUEEN AND I, AS A WITNESSING CITIZEN, CAN ONLY APPLAUD HER, AND GO PUKE BECAUSE LEMONSNOUT, THAT WAS REALLY FREAKING LOW</p>

<p><img src="../media/02042_1.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p><img src="../media/02042_2.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>As the prosecutor, it is your job to reach a final verdict and sentence the reprehensible felon, while His Tyranny watches in silence and submits grim approval. </p>

<p>I TOLD YOU THAT THEY DON&rsquo;T GIVE A FUCK AS LONG AS THE DEFENDANT KICKS THE BUCKET</p>

<p>But you take pity on this miserable bureaucrat. You are feeling merciful. You will give him a fighting chance. </p>

<p>WHAT</p>

<p>DIDN&rsquo;T YOU SAY YOU HAD BEEN AFTER HIM FOR A LONG TIME</p>

<p>I&rsquo;M GETTING MIXED SIGNALS OVER HERE</p>

<p>You will flip a DOUBLE-HEADED TROLL CAEGAR to decide his fate.</p>

<p>WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT</p>

<p>You do this quite often when making important decisions.</p>

<p>OH DEAR. Terezi, look deep into my eyes— pretend to look deep into my eyes SNIFF MY FUCKING EYES, WHATEVER IS YOUR EQUIVALENT (don&rsquo;t lick them tho), and promise me you will never ever ever ever pull out that idiotic coin to take decisions that will have real actual fucking repercussions because if you do I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL FLIP MY SHIT SO HARD THAT ANY TANTRUM THAT VANTAS EVER THREW WILL SOUND LIKE A SWEET LULLABY IN COMPARISON</p>

<p>I WILL EMIT SOUND WAVES SO HIGH THAT MY SCREAMS WILL SMASH WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE FOURTH WALL AND THEN REACH YOU</p>

<p>AND IN THAT MOMENT YOU WILL WISH YOU WERE DEAF INSTEAD OF BLIND</p>

<p>HAVE I BEEN CLEAR??? Of course I have been. Isn&rsquo;t a coin flip just about the easiest fucking way to create alternate timelines??? Terezi, what are you doing?? If you take that thing out every time you gotta take an important decision this will just become the messiest Sburb session ever. One day the Made of Time of this session will just show up and flip that coin into the sunset as she screams, and then disappear as she screams, not before punching you as she screams. Life is hard for Time Players.</p>

<p>Kind of like Batman&rsquo;s nemesis, Two-Face. Or that guy from No Country for Old Men. It turns out there are lots of badasses out there flipping coins. But those are Earth things and you&rsquo;ve never heard of them. It&rsquo;s safe to say you borrowed this gimmick from one of the many, many troll things out there that&rsquo;s got hard boiled dudes flipping coins for major stakes. You base the habit on whichever one smells the most badass.</p>

<p>Which means that this is just unoriginal.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02044_1.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p><img src="../media/02044_2.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>A favorable flip. The senator exhales in relief.</p>

<p>ARE YOU SHITTING ME</p>

<p>WHERE ARE YOUR MORALS TEREZI</p>

<p>I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALL ABOUT JUSTICE</p>

<p>WAS I WRONG ALL ALONG</p>

<p>SORRY I GOT INVESTED WITH THE STORY NOW</p>

<p>But, what are you so happy about, Mr. Lemonsnout? <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>He looks a bit confused. He quivers his lowly proboscis at the coin. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>See? The coin has exonerated him.</p>

<p><strong><em>NO</em></strong></p>

<p>OH MY GOD<br/>
OH MY FREAKING SHIT I KNOW WHERE SHE IS GOING</p>

<p>SEE? NO NO SHE DOES NOT ASKLWJDOIWJ THIS IS TOO CRUEL THIS IS JUST CRUELTY AT THIS POINT AND I LOVE IT</p>

<p><img src="../media/02046.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>SHE LOOKS LIKE A SUPERVILLAIN ALL GLOATING AND I CAN&rsquo;T TAKE THIS</p>

<p>Coin? What coin? <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>Surely you jest, Mr. Senator. The prosecution sees no coin.</p>

<p>FUCKAJDKNCWDC</p>

<p>​YOU LITTLE SHIT</p>

<p><img src="../media/02047.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>SHE&rsquo;S BLIND, REMEMBER?</p>

<p>I JUST SQUEALED OUT OF SHEER AWE<br/>
I JUST SQUEALED<br/><em>SQUEALED</em><br/>
I AM UTTERLY EMBARRASSED</p>

<p><img src="../media/02048_1.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p><img src="../media/02048_2retcon.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>THAT&rsquo;S ABRUPT</p>

<p>BUT THAT&rsquo;S OKAY IT WAS BEGINNING TO DRAG ON AFTER A WHILE</p>

<p>Execution of poor scalemates aside, that&rsquo;s a really nice forest that Terezi lives in. </p>

<p>&hellip;Wait&hellip;. Oh la la, who do I spot in the background?? It&rsquo;s been 38 sweeps since our last sighting. Or maybe I just missed a shit ton of them along the way. Anyway get outta here before Terezi&rsquo;s enhanced smell radar intercepts you and she puts you on trial for trespassing&hellip;&hellip; or is that <em>trees</em>passing&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. OH MY GOD I AM SORRY I WILL STOP</p>

<p><img src="../media/02049_1.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p><img src="../media/02049_2.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>OOOHHH!! THAT&rsquo;S SUCH A PRETTY TREE HOUSE!!! THE SCALEMATES SOMEHOW MAKE IT PRETTIER.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02050.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Terezi keeps being inappropriate with every member of the jury and His Tyranny. Is that how you plan on winning trials, young lady? Miss Morals?? We need to have a long, serious talk about that attitude of yours!</p>

<p>Another triumph for justice. The courtblock is adjourned. You offer final salutations to His Tyranny in the customary manner. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>Ok, that&rsquo;s not customary at all. You&rsquo;re just kind of weird. <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>It&rsquo;s just that your red chalk is THE MOST DELICIOUS CHALK. You cannot get enough of it. Anyone who says there is a more delicious chalk out there simply reeks of deceit.</p>

<p>*WV gulps guiltily as he swallows down another ton of green chalk*</p>

<p>Also Terezi is totally gonna exploit Dave only so that she can get to the sweet bright red of his words. I don&rsquo;t have it in my hearth to reprimand her. Color Addiction is a nightmare. You see those people&hellip; those poor poor people going around in bright yellow cars sometimes&hellip;&hellip;. at that stage it is almost always too late to go back to normal&hellip;..</p>

<p><img src="../media/02051.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>And as she uses books as a ladder, or as we should say to help her being a social climber and getting too cozy with Mister Tyranny, the witness&rsquo; family mourns, they lost a father and a husband today, nobody is even coming to collect the body, the beetles just gallivanting around will take care of it&hellip;&hellip; A tragedy unfolds under our uncaring eyes&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Okay what the actual fuck am i saying now seriously</p>

<p><img src="../media/02052.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>You take your WALKING CANE, which you use as a weapon kind of like Earth Daredevil who you&rsquo;ve never heard of. You will use it to wallop enemies when you enter the Medium.</p>

<p>CANEKIND. Impractical, but hardcore. Also now I must watch Daredevil and search for parallels, I only know their name, and I have to use they pronouns because I don&rsquo;t even effing know their gender. I am deeply ashamed.</p>

<p>Also, panels change, but the beetles remain in the same exact position through it&hellip;. I think&hellip;. well&hellip;. Rest In Pieces.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02053.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT YOU CAN FUCKING UPGRADE YOUR WEAPON.</p>

<p>Is that an harpoon. How resourceful. Okay kids, who had the brilliant idea of prototYPING WHAT IS PROBABLY A REAL LIFE DRAGON, JESUS FUCK. Let me talk to the dragon enthusiast. Congratu-fuckin-lation, Terezi. You just made this ten times more difficult. Where the fuck did you find a dragon anyway. One thing are the scales, <em>an entirely other one is the beast</em>. Go figure. Well, still a better choice than Cal, honestly.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s a cool land and different from what I expected for her, but okay. The ruins in the back and the streams give a sense of&hellip; calm?? and peace?? Which kind of stands against Terezi&rsquo;s personality, sprightly and active, I wonder if that&rsquo;s a Seer thing?? Getting lands that don&rsquo;t seem to fit you at first glance.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02054_2.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>GIRL YOU SEE BETTER THAN ME WHEN I FORGET MY GLASSES I FEEL SO FUCKING CHEATED</p>

<p>I have no idea if she has licked everybody&rsquo;s names but purposefully avoided Karkat&rsquo;s or if she only licked his name but both options are hilarious. Okay, the avoiding one is funnier, I must admit.</p>

<p>Your nose begins scouring your chumproll through the saliva smears on your monitor for potential teammates so you can start playing. Hmm, no not her. Nope, not her either. DEFINITELY not that guy. </p>

<p>IT WAS KARKAT. Is there anybody who you really like or do we have to jump straight to Gamzee? Seriously, girl. <em>Seriously.</em></p>

<p>Ok how about this girl. You like to roleplay with her sometimes via chat. </p>

<p>Yes, see!! So you don&rsquo;t have to always role play alone!! That&rsquo;s the magic of the internet!!</p>

<p>You pretend you are a member of the mysterious and noble DRAGONYY'YD RACE, while she does her own goofy thing. </p>

<p>YOU SAY THAT AS WE HAVEN&rsquo;T JUST WATCHED YOU TALK TO AND SLAP SOME PUPPETS AROUND AND STAGING FAKE MURDERS USING YOUR CURTAINS TO MAKE THE BLOOD</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have it in your heart to tell her that your chat RPing is meant f4c3t1ously I mean facetiously.</p>

<p>I DON&rsquo;T HAVE IT IN MY HEART TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE JERK</p>

<p>OH WAIT. I DO!! YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE JERK!!</p>

<p>First of all: you&rsquo;re all about law and yet so much insubordination, <em>so much</em>. ALSO!!!! She has a guardian that actually checks on her?? Whose authority is respected by AC?? I&rsquo;m not going to fall for this!! I&rsquo;M NOT!!!! Last time there seemed to be an actual person that knew what they were doing in the parenting field they turned out to be A FUCKING DOG.</p>

<p>AC: :33 &lt; i know! <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>AC: :33 &lt; but still im kind of scared of him and i think purrhaps its best to just run it by him first so there isnt a kerfuffle about it or anything <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>GC: TH1S 1S STUP1D 1N SUCH 4 T3RR1BL3 MYR14D OF DUMB W4YS <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>GC: YOU SHOULDNT B3 4FR41D OF 4NYON3 <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);"/>GC: YOU K1LL B1G 4NIM4LS W1TH YOUR B4R3 H4NDS! </p>

<p>SHE DOES WHAT????</p>

<p>Isn't roleplaying to pretend to be someone who is different from you?? Like Miss Lady Dragon Whatever? Getting to experience things that you couldn&rsquo;t while being yourself!? If she does this everyday FOR REAL I don&rsquo;t see the point in roleplaying. Does she just do it so that she can pretend&hellip;. to be&hellip;.a&hellip;..cat&hellip;.. OH FUCK. OH FUCK ME. ANOTHER DAMNED FURRY. ANOTHER FURRY. JUST WHAT THIS WEBCOMIC NEEDED. JUST COVER ME IN FURRIES. SEE IF I CARE.

<p>Okay, so perhaps it&rsquo;s not her guardian. I don&rsquo;t like this. The whole being scared thing. Smells fishy as fuck. And not even the kind of fishy that AC would like as a cat. </p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s just clawful. How much do you wanna bet that it won&rsquo;t be just fine and it delay her entry as much as pawssible??</p>

<p><img src="../media/02056_retcon.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>You then proceed to have the rest of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003924" style="font-family: courier, monospace; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);" target="_blank">this conversation we already read</a>.

<p><em>KARKAT</em></p>

<p><img src="../media/02057.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>Oh no. Not Karkat.</p>

<p>TIME TO FACE THE MUSIC DARLING</p>

<p>You were only going to ask him as a last resort. You wonder what he wants? You will try to avoid mentioning the game. Hopefully he hasn&rsquo;t caught wind of it yet.</p>

<p>He has caught wind, rain, snow and fog of it. And he is after your leadership and everything you own. Possibly also after the booty. That much is unclear.</p>

<p><img src="../media/02058.gif" alt="image"/></p>

<p>He is not&hellip;. smashing the keyboard&hellip;? Nor screaming&hellip;? This is. Oh, my. Girl, you were right, he&rsquo;s so into you. He looks like he has found inner peace. At last. His hands are not even clenching or anything. He couldn&rsquo;t look calmer if he had just eaten one of Gamzee&rsquo;s pies. Love truly is a magical experience. You have a gift, Terezi. Now go get the boy!!! If you want to, I mean. I still don&rsquo;t get what you see in him but okay.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m definitely not up for the Karkat Brand Of Bitchiness right now. So for the time being, I beg your pardon, but I&rsquo;m leaving and I&rsquo;m going to sleep for ten consecutive hours because my head is throbbing.</p>

<p>And when I&rsquo;m back I will be ready for a round of Karkat and Terezi getting all kawaii with each other or just Karkat being the huge fucking tsundere that we all know and love. &hellip;So to speak. See ya!!</p>
