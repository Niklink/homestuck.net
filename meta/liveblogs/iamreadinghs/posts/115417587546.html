<h2>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT. (Which turned out not to be that important, after all.)</h2>
<p>So you may have noticed I haven’t been liveblogging in the past few days, right? Well, I’ve got good news and bad news regarding that. I will just drop it. After eight years of loyal service, my computer died a couple of days ago. Like… It refuses to turn on. At all. It’s devoid of any life, CAPUT. It may or may not have been my fault? But honestly, my a-little-too-forceful kicks to the desktop just before it shut down on its own and died is obliviously just a coincidence. Obviously. (I suspect a sabotage, I DID have an ongoing bet with my ask screener to begin Act 4 before April 13th, duh. I accuse him of witchcraft.) </p><p>BUUUUUT, there was good news, wasn’t there? I kept liveblogging and I am just finished reading the intermission! I’m posting the whole thing as soon as I get my hands on my sweet new buy! Which should be either tomorrow or on Tuesday. </p><p>So, the intermission. I will let the facts speak for themselves. I read the thing in one sitting. I never read so much so fast. More than 200 pages in one evening. I ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY. And I seriously fail to understand why anyone would choose to skip it. The characters are incredibly charming, incredibly moronic but also incredibly charming. Well, they WERE charming, until SOMEONE *glares accusingly at Spades Slick* just HAD to indirectly kill them all. Rest in pieces, everyone. At least Snowman and the universe were spared.</p><p>Following the characters through weird time shenanigans, be-headings, occasional cannibalism, flipping sprites, the tidbits of Homestuck, and the horrible puns, was a wonderful experience. The intermission gave me so much satisfactions, you have no idea. I finally could put my wild theorist abilities to use! I wish it lasted a little longer. I WISH I GOT TO SEE MORE TROLLS??? AND THEY’RE ALIENS??? The reveal wasn’t that big, I kind of figured it out shortly before I got to that point. Well, more than figured it out, I accepted the hard truth. But I don’t know why I’m telling you all this, since I will be posting it soon. I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE INTERMISSION. Also, my happiness and relief about the fact that the aliens at least didn&rsquo;t turn out to be green tentacles monsters. Which was my main concern.</p><p>The sad thing is that I had to stop at the beginning of Act 4 because there is a flash game just at the beginning! The beautiful thing is that I DID begin Act 4 so it’s time to cash in my bet! </p><p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that my ask screener provided me with a test to discover what my title in Sburb would be and apparently I am a Mage of Heart?? I am not sure what I could do. But I would enchant everyone’s heart while doing it, that’s an undeniable fact.</p>
