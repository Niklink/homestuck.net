<p>But the real question is: </p><p>Does DAD do all this for laughs and/or to piss off his son or is he genuinely well meaning? Because that changes a lot.</p><p>Is he just like &lsquo;Here SON, take all this damned cakes because it is your BIRTHDAY and I am so PROUD of you, SON! Also all that harlequins stuff, you obviously LOVE it, right? How can someone NOT like it!&rsquo;</p><p>And John does nothing to stop this, and just shrugs it off as his father being weird?? But DAD is trying? Am I making myself SAD?!? Over faceless parents in a webcomic?? I need to get a grip!?!</p>
