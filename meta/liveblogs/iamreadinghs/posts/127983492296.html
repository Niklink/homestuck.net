<p>I apologize beforehand for the shortness of this post, but I am somewhat justified by the fact that I won’t make you wait a month for the next one!!

Because Pulse goes with anger and also with blood itself and Haze would be the result of said anger that clouds the judgement and makes you mess up when you can&rsquo;t think straight. So basically it is flaunting Karkat&rsquo;s flaws. Wow. Rude.</p><p>And Jesus Christ those stairs don&rsquo;t look navigable and if you fall you either get freaking impaled on one of those rocks or take a swim in blood. Disgusting. How dense is blood anyway. Would he even be able to float, let alone swim? Also disgusting. Did I mention that it would be disgusting??? Disgusting.</p><p>Further research (two minutes on google) show that it is actually possible to swim in blood! It would be kind of sickening (YOU DON&rsquo;T SAY) and considering that blood is more viscous it would be harder to move, you would have to swim slow but it is also actually easier to float in blood! So yeah, overall, you could. But why would you want to??</p><p>RIGHT! Now that I&rsquo;ve erased my fears of Karkat drowning into blood, I can go on! </p><p>Oh!! And we cannot overlook the most important detail!! We got ourselves a sweet second knight.

Then again he knows that she is blue blooded so. Well he sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t have blue blood as fun as that would have been. I would have loved it. Red seems too obvious. And Terezi would have figured it out. Which makes me think that the blood on the land is actually not troll blood. Carapacian blood, most probably. She wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized it as such.

So keep it up that way so that I don’t groan next time you type a heart and send it to the boy! And don’t exaggerate on the “you’re so cute” thing either!

A cool dude like this probably has a real cool name. Or at least a name that doesn&rsquo;t completely fucking suck.
