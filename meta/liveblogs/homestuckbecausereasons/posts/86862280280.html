<h2>Oh my god I love your stance on Vriska, it's so rare in the fandom. You see what she's doing to Tavros as horrible BUT you are not blind to her better moments. You are not prejudiced. That's such a rare thing. Now, I'm not sure what your spoiler screener will have to say on this, but just a reminder: all trolls are 13 years old. Including Vriska. When she jumped Tavros off the cliff, she was even younger. So, uh. Remember that when you judge her.</h2>
<p>Thanks so much! Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard to judge any of them too harshly when they&rsquo;re so young. And unlike a lot of anime I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, they actually do act mostly like 13-year-olds. And this is why we do not trust children with psychic powers. They do stupid things without necessarily being bad people. And they deserve some leeway because they&rsquo;re still learning to be moral people, and obviously right now they don&rsquo;t even have anyone to guide them except for the lusus and their own experience. </p>
