<p>And here is Feferi Peixes, who would be next queen of the trolls if all the trolls weren&rsquo;t about to die. She is responsible for keeping Erindan from killing everybody. </p>
<p>It looks like she has multiple lususes, the horsefish and the giant monster that eats other lusus, which is kind of heartbreaking since she&rsquo;s basically feeding it kids&rsquo; parents. I mean, I know she has to, but it&rsquo;s still sad. </p>
<p>She seems nice enough, like she wants to make a big difference in troll society, and she&rsquo;s very down to earth for a princess who is being raised by a giant monster.</p>
