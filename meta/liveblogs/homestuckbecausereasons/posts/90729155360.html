<h2>I made some notes while I had no power and was reading past stuff!</h2>
<blockquote>
<div>I have no power but I can read the act 6 search page, so while I do that I will write down some thoughts to post later. </div>
<div></div>
<div>In a conversation with Jane, Calliope says she is not in Jane&rsquo;s solar system but much farther away, in a different universe. Except we just saw that she&rsquo;s living on earth. I considered that she could be from a different part of her timeline but I&rsquo;m not sure that makes sense. </div>
<div></div>
<div>At first I thought that Caliborn was lying about lil cal being a bad sign, but after rereading his conversations, he seems honestly disgusted with cal for being a puppet, the same way he was mad at the auto responder for not being an actual person. I&rsquo;m pretty sure this hatred for person-like objects or beings is relevant somehow. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Also with all Caliborn&rsquo;s talk of shitty twist endings and red herrings I wonder if it won&rsquo;t turn out that he isn&rsquo;t Lord English. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there&rsquo;s something worse than him waiting in the wings. Who knows, maybe doc scratch is behind everything after all. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I assumed everything Calliope said about her species was about the trolls, now I wonder. She could be lying, using the details she got from roses book or she could, be telling the truth and it just turns out they&rsquo;re close enough to trolls to allow for assumptions. Like her ancestors precede her by millennia&hellip;might explain things a bit. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also super love dialoglog. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Fuck, I can&rsquo;t get to the act 6 scripts anymore. I have 1-4 and 5 though. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I forgot that Sollux predicted his death like, completely accurately. Wow. Oh god and then he goes on to compare himself, a prophet, going blind to an angel gettings it&rsquo;s wings. And says angels are terrible creatures which paradox space uses to usher in &ldquo;the end.&rdquo; So I guess Caliborn and Calliope are due for some feathery flappers. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Huh, Aradia just said that prototyping the frog head would be vital to later success. I can&rsquo;t remember if that happened yet&hellip;but considering the trolls failed and Aradia and the voices knew she would fail, I wonder if it will come into play later, with some future genesis frog or something. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I should remember next time I have my notes to see if the screen name initial pairs (ie tc and ct) have any significance now that we know the aspects and classes are paired. </div>
