<p>The degree to which self hatred is a theme in this comic is a little disturbing. Karkat hated his past and future selves, Jade hated Jadesprite, now Dirk is hating both himself and the auto-responder. At least he&rsquo;s self-aware about it. But the poor thing, I just feel so bad for him. His boyfriend is a bit of a dick, and making a copy of yourself is just a terrible idea.</p>
