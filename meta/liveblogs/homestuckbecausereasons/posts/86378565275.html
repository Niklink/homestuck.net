<h2>Hussie just has this amazing knack for puns, double meanings, symmetry, and parallelism. At least, that's the impression I get just from a cursory glance at everything troll. It's kind of like a game-- see if you can spot them all! (Note: Don't actually do that. Try shooting for a reasonable number instead. We've lost a lot of good, hard-working, dedicated fans to the Hussie Hunt. Let us have a moment of silence and a single tear of black liquid sorrow shed in their honor.)</h2>
<p>May they rest in peace.</p>
