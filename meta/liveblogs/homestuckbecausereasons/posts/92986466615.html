<h2>So, ships!</h2>
<p>So being gay myself, I mostly prefer lgb ships. I would expect that there&rsquo;d be more of that in Homestuck, given trolls are completely bisexual, but it&rsquo;s super hetero up in here, so I&rsquo;m not really interested in canon ships.</p>
<p>Kanaya/Rose is my OTP and I&rsquo;ll be so heartbroken forever if they break up.</p>
<p>I keep waiting for Nepeta/Karkat to happen. It feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of foreshadowing, with Nepeta being the shipping ace and all, but Nepeta is totally dead and barely present, so maybe not.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for Karkat/Dave. Dave being constantly snarky and Karkat being constantly earnestly angry just seems like a fine combination. But Dave also is on the record as not being interested in being in an open relationship, and while Karkat doesn&rsquo;t seem to be actively involved in any kismesis relationships, he also doesn&rsquo;t seem to be willing to reject it. But I am overthinking a relationship that probably will never be canon.</p>
<p>And I really, really, really want to see Dirk in a happy relationship. Because he is a doll, and also canon gay.</p>
<p>Mostly I care about seeing the platonic relationships. I adore Nepeta/Equius as moirails, they&rsquo;re so effing cute. So are Vriska and Meenah. I wanna see Vriska and Terezi together again, too. And&hellip;more friendships everywhere.</p>
