<p class="p1">I&rsquo;m a little disappointed I got ambiently spoiled about who this guy is. I guess my new friends were right when they told me to avoid Homestuck spoilers at all costs, but it was a bit hard considering everyone is obsessed with him and it took me a while to put Homestuck on the blacklist.</p>
