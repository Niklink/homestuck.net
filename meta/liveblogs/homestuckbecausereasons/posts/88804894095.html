<h2>Something you might not have noticed, when Jade fused with Jadesprite and went Godtier she also fused with Bec, technically Jade is now a First Guardian as well as a GodTier Witch of Space.  Which explains why she is so HAX.</h2>
<p>Oh, I got that! I meant to say (but I guess did not) that it was lucky they didn&rsquo;t ~destroy~ the Green Sun, since Jade would now be drawing power from it, and along with the Godtier powers would probably be a serious threat to Jack.</p>
<p>And then of course they created the Green Sun instead, so I guess that point is moot. But either way, super!Jade is completely awesome.</p>
