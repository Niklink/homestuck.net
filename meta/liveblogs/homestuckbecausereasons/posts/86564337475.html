<p>And now time for some out of order liveblogging, because I am so bad at this whole thing. I have zero discipline so I just kept reading on and was like, I will respond properly later. </p>
<p>Wait okay. People knew that Aradia was dead, and like, had no problem with continuing to chat with her? I mean, okay, they do have all kinds of psychic powers, and apparently ghosts can just show up and haunt people, but still, what kind of planet are they living on? Did just some of them think she was dead and not tell anyone else? Because <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004046">Sollux clearly thought he could see Aradia if she was outside his window</a> but later Doc Scratch says that Terezi thinks &ldquo;their friend&rdquo; is dead and Aradia is the only one I know of who would fit. </p>
<p>I guess CaligulasAquarium or CuttlefishCuller could be that friend, since I haven&rsquo;t learned anything about them except their screen names.</p>
