<h2><a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003701">WV?: Rise Up</a></h2>
<p class="p1">When Rose&rsquo;s kernel joins, will that introduce the time dimension or something? Because it&rsquo;s already 3D, right? So time is left?</p>
<p class="p1">Damn, Jack is just regiciding everywhere. And WV came so close to stopping the war! Or at least pausing the battle for a second.</p>
<p class="p1">Did Jack destroy the kernel scepter or can he grab it and use it and become super Jack? </p>
<p class="p1">And OH NO PM go get that other scepter! Even though the four kernel things vanished? </p>
<p class="p1">Now both the white queen and king have abdicated, and the black queen and king have been killed. Jack has the BQ&rsquo;s ring and possibly the BK&rsquo;s scepter, dream Jade has the WQ&rsquo;s ring (but is unaffected by its power) and nobody has the scepter. I guess the whole two kingdoms vs. each other thing is over?</p>
