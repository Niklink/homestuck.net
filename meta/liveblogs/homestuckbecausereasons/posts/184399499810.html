<p>Okay so I’m going to start reading the Epilogues. At least some of them. </p><p>Initially, I was going to say I was going to start with Candy because it sounds like it will be the shorter, lighter one. You know, I was expecting it to be the like, bad ending. How some games have a fuck up state, where you picked the wrong option and everyone dies or something and the game makes you go back. I’m pretty sure that’s wrong (maybe not everyone dying? everyone might die), but I’ll go with my first instinct anyway. Even though I was warned not to.</p><p>I’m really suspicious of Roxy and Calliope at the beginning of Candy. It makes me sure that they knew that John wasn’t coming back. But I also question why they wouldn’t agree with Rose that Lord English needs to be fought, properly.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="1170"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_pqfsd5vuZc1qj3pg6_1280.png" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="1170"/></figure><p>This is a muse of space thing, right? Earth C has been outside of canon, but it’s also been building towards this decision, and Calliope must have felt that. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="224" data-orig-width="1198"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_pqfsi34luV1qj3pg6_1280.png" data-orig-height="224" data-orig-width="1198"/></figure><p>I do not trust this Callie. I do not trust her at all. “I have such big plans for you” is not a thing you just say. And she offered him the candy/meat choice, and then pulls this? Nope. Rose explained to John what meat entailed. She gave him the information he needed to make that choice. And then Callie/Roxy present the candy option like it’s “Oh just stay home!” and then when he makes it we find out that they have <i>plans</i>? </p>
