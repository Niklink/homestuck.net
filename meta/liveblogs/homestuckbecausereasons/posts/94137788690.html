<p>Any guesses about what lies in the future for Aranea?</p>

<p>I really think Roxy is going to wake up and steal the ring for Calliope. I mean, she&rsquo;s a rogue, so stealing things for the benefit of others is right in her wheelhouse.</p>
<p>At that point we find out if continuing to wear the ring is necessary to continue living. The characters continually suggest it is, but that could be a big red herring. I think she won&rsquo;t be able to stay alive without it, but I also think she won&rsquo;t go back to being a ghost. BKEW told me about his theory that the ring of life and the ring of void are the same, and on that note I think she might end up on the void side of thing. She&rsquo;s currently all full of life on like a dozen different levels, so removing the ring could end up double killing her, or she miiiiight invert to an <strike>heir of doom</strike> prince of void (no more 2AM blogging for Milli).</p>
<p>Either way I don&rsquo;t see her making it out of here in a good state. She&rsquo;s demonstrated too much arrogance to not have a huge punishment coming. I&rsquo;m still really pissed at her for killing Jade, even if Jade was possessed. </p>
