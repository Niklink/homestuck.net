<p>!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>So it looks like now we have two trolls! One with the Caduceus symbol, and one with the Ophiuchus symbol. Also I just discovered on Wikipedia that the Caduceus/rod of Asclepius can be the symbol for the asteroid Hygeia.</p>
<p>So Ophiuchus the constellation represents the god Asclepius, who was raised by a centaur and could bring people back from the dead. Hygeia was his daughter and goddess of health. Considering the number of dead characters we have, this is potentially v. important information!</p>
