<p>Oh man, I love this whole Toph Beifong type joke, where Terezi (or Toph) can&rsquo;t see but she can sense well enough that people don&rsquo;t realize or forget it, and she&rsquo;s just totally deadpan about it. </p>
<p>Also ohmygod, Meenah on the floor with her legs in the air, totally overcome with how awesome her alternate self is. So awesome that she can get pummeled and not give a flying fuck.</p>
<p>Also, Terezi is sniffing the heck out of Dirk because he smells kind of like Dave, right? And Dave is seeing his bro, except as his peer, and ohmygod I just realized that the reason the alpha kids are entering the game a few years older than the beta kids did is so that they&rsquo;ll be the same age when they meet up.</p>
