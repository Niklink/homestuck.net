<p>OKAY So I haven’t seen anyone talking about how PM punched out Jade.</p><p>PM is like, the good one, right? But Jade is 1. also good, and 2. an innocent in their fight. And having Bec in her should make it really hard, if not impossible, for her to hurt Jade, right?</p><p>My theory, that I can manage from my broken brain, is that while Jack Noir is a bad guy, that’s not enough to override the Bec part of him that loves Jade ever so much. But PM is *righteous* and love for Jade won’t stop her from doing the right thing. </p><p>An idea for what this means: There’s a bunch of parallels between her and Jack, and the cherubs. And alt!Calliope is already not the nicest, not the warmest, not close to anyone in particular…Maybe this is foreshadowing that the destruction of the Green Sun (or whatever it is she’s about to do, I’m not sure it’ll be destruction) could be a major sacrifice.</p><p>But then that means that bad things might happen to Jade and that is really NOT okay.</p>
