<p>This upd8 was pretty light so I have very little to say. But I’ll say something anyway?</p><p>First, I liked going back to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=009415">when Vriska laid out her plan for the final fights</a>, as a refresher for what’s going on. I thought you guys might appreciate the link.</p><p>Curious how the first text introduces Spades Slick the same way <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003055">he was introduced in the intermission</a>. The first intermission. Obviously we are now in for a lot more time shenanigans (which was a given, anyway). Also, at last, Spades Slick can get vengeance on Lord English. Like he wanted thousands of pages ago. Daaaaamn that was a long time coming. </p><p>So Dirk and Dave are waiting for Lord Jack. But Robo Jack is about to engage him, with only Jake as backup, if Jake chooses to help, and the Felt as well if they land for battle. That’s&hellip;not good. And Robo Jack has LE’s pool cue, which I’m preeeeeeetty sure won’t be very good for Dirk and Dave if LJ is allowed to get it and continue on. But maybe LJ will get waylaid completely and it’ll give Dave and Dirk time to talk about being gay, and that would be best.</p><p>I’m pretty sure that fourth wall break is going to be significant somehow, but it beats me how. It amused me though. </p><p>That’s kind of it for now! See you all tomorrow!</p><p>Oh also Jake was beyond adorable.</p>
