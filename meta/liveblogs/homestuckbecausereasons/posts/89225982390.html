<p>Now we meet Dirk Strider!</p>
<p>From the chat logs he&rsquo;s about the only one I like. He uses lovely grammar and punctuation, he&rsquo;s a nice guy, he isn&rsquo;t crass, and he&rsquo;s pretty straightforward, which is a nice change of pace. </p>
<p>But he likes puppets. Why can&rsquo;t we be free of the fucking puppets? Also he appears to be some kind of furry.</p>
<p>Anyway, he&rsquo;s cool like Dave, but less insecure about it. Which makes sense, because, y'know, Dave was raised by bro/Dirk, and that had to screw with him something terrible. I mean, the guy appears to have a sexual attraction to humanized animals and fuzzy toys, so of course Dave is going to be constantly insisting that the puppet thing is totally ironic.</p>
