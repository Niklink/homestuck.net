<p>I’ve put my finger on my problem with the current upd8s and now I can enjoy them a lot more.</p><p>They’re basically in a false falling action. Or at least that’s what all of the characters, except Terezi, think it is. They think that the story is over, it’s denouement time, so they’re all fine with just reuniting and getting ready to collect their reward. The bad guys are dead, they’re over their emotional issues, their quests have been finished. As far as they’re concerned. We’re not getting dialogue because the characters are done talking because they’ve said all that they need to say, or at least the really important stuff. It’s the end, it’s time to charge on to the epilogue. </p><p>Meanwhile, we’re sitting here being annoyed because we know it’s not the end. We’ve got our lists of enemies still floating around, and the quests that haven’t been done, and all the loose ends that won’t be tied up by them going through the door. We know that there’s another act between now and the end. We’re basically the stereotypical horror movie watcher, yelling at the screen that the monster is in the room do not go in there. Why did you turn your back on Her Imperious Condescension? Of course Vriska couldn’t kill Lord English on her own and that’s why she’s not here. </p><p>Or at least that’s how I like to think about it right now. It’s frustrating, but it makes sense. It would be a lot less frustrating if we didn’t know that we’re two days from the end of everything and if we weren’t told that act 7 is two effing pages. </p>
