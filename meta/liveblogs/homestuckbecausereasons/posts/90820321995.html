<p>So I had to hit the Google machine and look up Yaldabaoth. Apparently that&rsquo;s one name for some kind of creator figure, the Demiurge, son of either chaos or void, who maybe created mankind and then got jealous of us (of course, we are pretty great) and did the whole tree of knowledge BS. He&rsquo;s basically God, but malevolent. His gnostic myths are pretty interesting, at least on the wiki. He seems to be generally associated with arrogance.</p>
<p>So, his denizen has a heavy creator bent, and for him victor and defeat will have nothing to do at all with creating a universe. I wonder if victory for him had something to do with creating the Green Sun? </p>
