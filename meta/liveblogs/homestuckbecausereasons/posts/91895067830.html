<p>BACK ON TOPIC!</p>
<p>Interesting how the path of the conqueror is listed as the active choice, so the martyr might be passive, just like the class pairs we&rsquo;re already familiar with.</p>
<p>I suppose if Lord English was granted immortality with the god tier caveats, it wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a thing at all. Anyone killing him, under any circumstances, would be just, since he&rsquo;s just such a terrible dick. </p>
<p>I wonder if the limitless supply of power is the green sun&ndash;or is his power going to surpass even that? </p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic of vaguely suspicious wording, that last bit, about it being hardly considered a choice at all&hellip;that&rsquo;s a bit iffy, too. Obviously Caliborn wouldn&rsquo;t choose otherwise, but we&rsquo;re also used to our characters maybe not actually having choices&ndash;if everything is predetermined, does free will actually exist? Could someone be using Caliborn, or had this all preplanned in the vast temporal bullshit that is Homestuck?</p>
