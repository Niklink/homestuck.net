<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if it would work with the mother grub thing, but this makes me wonder a bit if troll reproduction wasn&rsquo;t designed to make the population more controllable. Nobody has family ties aside from their romantic relationships, nobody is particularly attached to the younger generation, inheritance (to kids anyway) isn&rsquo;t a thing, so property is easier to control, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably wrong but I&rsquo;m also putting it out there. Because you never know with this thing. But she&rsquo;s probably just trying to make humans more like trolls.</p>
