<p>Oh, I really like Aradia too. She&rsquo;s really pretty! And so mysterious. She plays everything close to the vest, doesn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>The  class element interests me. Apparently there&rsquo;s a big divide between the upper class and lower class and a loooooot of animosity between them. I gather the upper class is called the blue bloods, and lower is green bloods? I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention at first since blue blood is a standard term for the upper class. I guess Nepeta is a blue blood, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gotten the names of anyone else. But aside from Nepeta they do seem like not the best people. Especially since AG is one of them. And AG is terrible.</p>
