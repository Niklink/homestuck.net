<p class="p1">Some thoughts now that I&rsquo;ve had a second to think about this video:</p>
<p class="p1">Doesn&rsquo;t this mean that ultimately Vriska is responsible for the scratch and for ruining things, since she put John to sleep at the worst possible moment? </p>

<p class="p1">Also I am assuming it is deeply metaphoric that Jade&rsquo;s entry item thing was a piñata of Bec, considering that Bec was created by one of Jack's henchmen and may be evil. And that she ultimately shot it, which is what she was trying to do in the game where Bec wasn&rsquo;t letting her get to the package, when the green sun first appeared in his body. I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of it right now. I know each entry item is metaphorically significant, if not significant to the future story itself. And I get them metaphorically, vaguely, but not specifically. </p>
<p class="p1">If that makes sense, I&rsquo;ve had a long day.</p>
