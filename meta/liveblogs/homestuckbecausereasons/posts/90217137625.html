<p>Oh my god, Calliope is making me so sad right now. That poor, poor baby. She wants so hard to help people and to do the right thing, but her brother is pretty much the polar opposite, and now her facade is completely crumbling. She&rsquo;s not a troll, she doesn&rsquo;t know everything she thought she did, and now she&rsquo;s realizing she&rsquo;ll probably die.</p>
<p>Also I just realized she referenced being kissed to be resurrected, but that would only work if her dreamself was still alive. So I guess she doesn&rsquo;t know? Poor baby.</p>
