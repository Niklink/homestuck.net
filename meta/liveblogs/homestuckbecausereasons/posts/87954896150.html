<p>Sooooooo. Becquerel, first guardian of Earth, was made by the MEOW DNA written by Rose. And Doc Scratch, first guardian of Alternia, was made by a 24 digit sequence.</p>
<p>Okay, there could be overlap that reduces it down to 4, if each troll was writing hunks of the sequence in their own letters, but each of the letters translated to the same four&hellip;except for Vriska and Terezi, who wrote with 3 and 5 digits, which would make for a weird translation, if it&rsquo;s comparable to a DNA sequence. And except for Gamzee, unless the upper and lower case letters are exchangeable, which could make sense given how he types&hellip;</p>
<p><strike>Also, it&rsquo;s implied that Terezi and Vriska are sisters? I&rsquo;m not sure how troll biology and genetics works wrt siblings, I assume they&rsquo;re less closely related than John and Jade, but are they related through the same means? The journal Vriska got and the events it was supposed to mirror implied that they had different ancestors, but at that point who even knows. And if they don&rsquo;t really have the concept of siblings, then does it even matter? </strike>Never mind, this has been corrected. It&rsquo;s a play on Scourge Sisters, rather than them actually being sisters. Although how trolls have the concept of siblings is still odd.</p>
