<p>Now I&rsquo;ve met Sollux! Sollux apparently made their version of Sburb from glyphs in some ruin. That is impressive. And also who the fuck coded a game in glyphs thousands of years ago?</p>
<p>Actually I know it probably was like the frog temple thing that got sent through time during the reckoning and landed there and maybe Sollux himself did the glyphs so later he could read them and make the game and time travel madness.</p>
