<p>SO time for a belated proper response to the latest flash!</p><p>I couldn’t get the instagram to work so I actually took screen shots of everything, my god. I was too lazy to find a better way</p><!-- more --><figure data-orig-width="1550" data-orig-height="1070" class="tmblr-full"><img src="" alt="image" data-orig-width="1550" data-orig-height="1070"/></figure><p>So oh my god, penis ouija has been replaced with penis hopscotch. How adorable! And I know it’s probably belaboring the joke, but Karkat’s response makes me laugh, because that means he knows something about human penises, right? </p><figure data-orig-width="1508" data-orig-height="1076" class="tmblr-full"><img src="" alt="image" data-orig-width="1508" data-orig-height="1076"/></figure><p>Soooo I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about Vriska fixing everything and being a Mary Sue and shit (which annoys me because shit, people, that’s not what a Mary Sue is, and Vriska is hardly flawless) but look, most of her fixing involves cockblocking Gamzee. And preventing him from even starting anything. Look, she’s right there at the beginning of his kismesisitude with Terezi, preventing him from ruining everything there.</p><figure data-orig-width="1222" data-orig-height="1084" class="tmblr-full"><img src="" alt="image" data-orig-width="1222" data-orig-height="1084"/></figure><p>And here stopping Gamzee from getting his fake god tier costume. (And possibly something else? IIRC it was implied that he got something other than a codpiece from them.)</p><figure data-orig-width="1082" data-orig-height="984" class="tmblr-full"><img src="" alt="image" data-orig-width="1082" data-orig-height="984"/></figure><p>AND here she is keeping Gamzee from fucking with the alpha kids’ sprites. (And, lets be real, being totally adorable while doing it!) So everybody is going to have actually helpful sprites! </p><figure data-orig-width="1434" data-orig-height="1052" class="tmblr-full"><img src="" alt="image" data-orig-width="1434" data-orig-height="1052"/></figure><p>But my real question is&ndash;how did she know where to show up, and with what? We know ARquiussprite is important, and there she is with Equius’s head at the exact right moment&hellip;just like she showed up at the exact right moment for Jane, and hell, for Rose too. I mean, maybe it’s got something to do with stealing something somehow light related from Gamzee? Or maybe Terezi directed her??? </p><p>And maybe this means that Gamzee won’t be raising Caliborn/Calliope like he did. Vriska has the music boxes, so I don’t think Gamzee can get to the cherub’s Earth. Which could account for the Calliope Jade meant, maybe???? I’m so excited for the updates to get rolling again!</p>
