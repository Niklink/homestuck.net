<h2>Hussie used to have something posted somewhere where someone asked him about gender and classes, and he said that other than the master classes, if anything the female classes skew toward the active and the male classes skew toward the passive; he implied that witch is the most active regular class.  And a lot of the classes aren't gendered at all, or aren't strictly gendered. (E.g. thief is explicitly stated to be only mostly female, we see both male and female knights, seers, mages, rogues...)</h2>
<p>I figured it was something like that. That it seems bad at first because rawr equality but it has internal logic and shit.</p>
<p>It just seems odd that he would choose to have gender exclusive classes without explanation, and I&rsquo;m sooooo used to douchey sexist scifi/fantasy.</p>
<p>But like I said, it&rsquo;s not really worth complaining about. I&rsquo;d rather gush about holy shit, Rosemary is such a great ship that is never played for the male gaze and female friendships and women kicking ass and the Condesce.</p>
<p>Would anyone happen to have a link to that, though? I know people have access to like, all the stuff Hussie said but then deleted.</p>
