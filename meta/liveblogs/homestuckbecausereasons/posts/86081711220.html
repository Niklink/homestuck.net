<p>I do not like the Black Queen but I am DEFINITELY not okay with Jack cutting off her finger and then killing her. And stealing the sprite powers. Jack is probably way more dangerous than her. He seems seriously unhinged.</p>
<p>And he has whatever super weapon is in the green package. Which Jade says will return to John when he needs it but this is still not good. And soon he&rsquo;ll have whatever power comes from Jade&rsquo;s kernelsprite unless she&rsquo;s intentionally avoiding going to the Medium which wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, tbh. </p>
