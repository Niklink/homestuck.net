<p>So, when I said that Karkat was making a political statement with the symbol/color, this is what I was thinking of. There&rsquo;s Redglare (right?) wearing the symbol (although I think right then it&rsquo;s more of a secret) to signify that she&rsquo;s a follower of the Signless/Sufferer, so maybe Karkat wearing the symbol is also a political statement, and not just a &ldquo;Fuck you my blood is private&rdquo; thing. </p>
<p>I mean, he did say that he thinks the hemospectrum caste system is stupid, too. But that could also be a cover up for his candy apple red blood. Probably a chicken or the egg thing.</p>
