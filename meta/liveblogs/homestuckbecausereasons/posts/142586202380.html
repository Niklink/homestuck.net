<p>I didn’t do an update post for yesterday because I was <a href="http://grammarmancer.tumblr.com/post/142531783674/ipgd-replying-to-my-homestuck-blog-like-seriously">thoroughly freaked out</a> by ipgd replying to my post about act 7 being two pages. </p><p>I really want to be happy about this upd8 but it’s really effing ominous. </p><figure data-orig-width="650" data-orig-height="650" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o5flyuQW3R1qj3pg6_540.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="650" data-orig-height="650"/></figure><p>Because<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004499"> the last time we saw a group of victorious heroes on the lilypad</a> was right before Bec Noir entered their session (via a scratch! which I wanted to ask BKEW about but he just went idle on AIM, shucks) and kept them from entering their newly created universe. </p><p>Also, do you notice something missing from that red house?</p><figure data-orig-width="514" data-orig-height="458" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o5fm79lnal1qj3pg6_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="514" data-orig-height="458"/></figure><p><strike>Where is the door??????</strike></p><p><strike>People have also pointed out that it’s not flipped, like the red icon was, which may be an oversight by a guest artist, but I’m pretty sure you don’t just forget to add a door. Especially since the<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004501"> following panels</a> really focus on the doorknob. So that’s one major difference, and one potentially major strange thing. </strike></p><p>Thanks to <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/maZ-ge8IVTY0QLCtxJj_67A">@askcharlierobinson</a> for <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/142587167875/what-makes-the-pages-of-them-on-the-meteor-even">pointing out that there’s no door</a> because the frog hasn’t been turned into a universe yet!</p><figure data-orig-width="496" data-orig-height="554" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o5fmiazLgR1qj3pg6_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="496" data-orig-height="554"/></figure><p>And Terezi definitely noticed that Vriska isn’t there. She’s walking to the edge of the platform to watch for her to fly in, I assume. I also assume that this is going to be about the point where someone else will be showing up. </p><p>There’s just too many parallels between how Aradia describes Bec Noir entering their session, and the session that we’re seeing supposedly about to end right here. </p><p>But all that aside, getting to see everyone be friends again was pretty sweet. It looks like Dirk apologized to Jake, Kanaya and Rose are obviously still so happy together, Jade and John reunite&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width="826" data-orig-height="698" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o5fmu1zueh1qj3pg6_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="826" data-orig-height="698"/></figure><p>Roxy literally hauls Jane in for a group hug with Callie, who is clinging to her SO ADORABLY! </p><figure data-orig-width="834" data-orig-height="934" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o5fmvuopqb1qj3pg6_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="834" data-orig-height="934"/></figure><p>Dave and Karkat’s reunion leaves a bit to be desired, and I wonder if it would be a bit more explicitly red if they’d known how much people were denying that they’re matesprits not moirails. I mean it’s adorable and I don’t expect either of them to make out in front of everybody, before Dave has even come out, but it’s also super chill and without dialogue that’s disappointing.</p><p>I’m so excited to see John and Dad reunite, even if it’s a completely different version of Dad? Actually that makes it kind of weird&hellip;we know that the guardians are special, and that seemed to apply even to the non-player guardians, but&hellip;hm. </p>
