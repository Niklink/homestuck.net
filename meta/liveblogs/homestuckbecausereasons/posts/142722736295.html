<h2>What. The. Fuck.</h2>
<p>That was really pretty but I would have traded every drop of gorgeous animation for just fucking text. And like, shitty sketches.</p><p>Hell, even if the characters just talked about their relationships and we never learned anything about the mysteries.</p><p>I feel so dumb for everything I wrote about how we were getting a false denouement. I can’t believe it was all real. I can’t believe the reason we got no dialogue was because it was over and the characters were done talking.</p><p>And a lot of Collision feels like a lie. So much of it was ominious, especially at the end&hellip;and now it’s nothing.</p><p>I just&hellip;like, I haven’t been in the fandom for nearly as long as a lot of you all, and I haven’t done the theory crafting like some of you, but I feel betrayed. Maybe only by myself and my own expectations, but also by my faith that Hussie was taking so long because he wasn’t sick of Homestuck and we were going to get a decent ending, but betrayed none the less.</p><p>Not that this wasn’t “decent” but it really sort of stopped being Homestuck. Homestuck was mostly pictures and dialogue and&hellip;we got none of that. </p>
