I really wonder what it looks like in universe, for alt!Calliope to suddenly be speaking not with dialogue but with narration. For us it’s obvious, because we’re used to the separation and we can see it visually, but Aradia also had an experience where alt!Calliope stopped speaking and started narrating. I don’t think it’s a Space thing to suddenly be part of the narrative voice, rather than a character speaking, because I can’t relate it to Kanaya or Jade’s powers. Is it a Muse thing? Like how Lord English is always Already Here, which is time like but beyond anything that Aradia or Dave can accomplish, can a Muse of Space become the story rather than being a character in it?</p><p>Also it is interesting that they use the story of the Sufferer here, with alt!Calliope using the text color that matches his blood color. There’s always been a connection between the cherubs and the Sufferer/Karkat that I don’t think got enough attention. I sort of assumed that we weren’t getting more of it because Alternian lore is more a part of Hiveswap than Homestuck now, and that’s where we’ll learn more about the limebloods (if we ever do, hope springs eternal) and from there the cherubs. But also this feels like foreshadowing, and you all know whether or not it is or if the foreshadowing is for something else related to the Sufferer or if it’s just the story they chose for this moment, but I’m taking a moment to meditate and reveal my ignorance.</p><p>Also also they really said Fuck Off to the pacing here. The story was moving along at a pretty good clip, and then alt!Calliope pulls it to a sudden stop to explain to us how all stories are propaganda with a speaker and a point of view, no matter how objective they feel.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="1190"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_pr03utB0fx1qj3pg6_1280.png" data-orig-height="270" data-orig-width="1190"/></figure><p>*claps hands and stomps feet* CALMASIS CALMASIS CALMASIS </p>
