<p>I get the feeling that aside from having incredibly questionable judgment and being really mean, Vriska does care about people. She could just make Tavros kill her, which would get her what she wants and make Tavros suffer, but she actually wants him to make the decision. And her dream self is getting more and more covered in blood, but she&rsquo;s still not taking his will! </p>
<p>I kind of adore Vriska. I just would never ever ever want to ever interact with her.</p>
