<p>Y'know, I&rsquo;d really suspected that they were two aspects of the same person, or one person with two personalities or two souls. It would explain how uu could fuck up UU&rsquo;s shit without them having ever met, if only one of them has the body at a time, or something. Not to mention the Complacency of the Learned parallels and the main character being neither male nor female, or being both.</p>
