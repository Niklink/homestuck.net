<p>Thoughts on third viewing:</p><p>I can’t overstate how great it is to see almost everyone happy or hopeful in this version of events. Rather than grim and serious like in the Game Over version. </p><p>The Condy fight is hilarious because like, you see Kanaya being silly in the background when she’s not fighting, but it’s turn based for everyone. They all just wait their turns unless they’re doing a fraymotif (in which case it is their turn).</p><p>I 100% get why he did it on Youtube, even if the fan base is much much smaller it would be so hard on the servers, but I really do wish this was a flash instead and we got to see it messing with our browsers like in other flashes. Like when Cans punches people back and forth through the timeline…ah, what could have been.</p><p>I disagree that Dirk got fraymotif resurrected because he would have permadied otherwise. We’ve seen god tier resurrections take some time, and watching the fight, if it was just Terezi and Dave for an extended period of time, it could have been really bad for them. It takes all three of them to keep the Jacks busy! Better for them to resurrect him than risk something bad happening while they wait for it to happen automatically.</p><p>Dirk’s control over his aspect seems particularly weak compared with everyone else’s, including Terezi, who isn’t even god tier. He just doesn’t seem to do much damage and his attacks seem to get interrupted faster, but maybe that’s just me? It’s so hard to tell, everything happens so fast. But he also hasn’t successfully used it yet, except in Caliborn’s Masterpiece!</p><p>ARquius’s reaction to Dad is really curious. Dirk didn’t seem to have any attachment to Dad that would lead to it…</p><p>Seriously, WTF is with Yaldabaoth’s face when he attacks Caliborn? Really. I feel like it’s a reference to something but I do not know what.</p><p>I really wonder what’s about to happen with Vriska and Lord English. She was really conspicuously absent during the fight, and especially at the end, when LE appears to be victorious over everyone attacking him. And we only saw Hussie there, fighting her. Was he keeping her out of the way, until she would be narratively most powerful? </p><p>Okay so when Dirk is being choked out and does the serious face, I don’t think he was signaling to Dave that it was okay to sacrifice him to kill the Jacks. The blocking doesn’t seem to work. Dave is off to the far right of Dirk, looking at him in profile, while Dirk is looking straight ahead. I think he’s accepting that Jack might kill him? </p><p>Lord Jack made a black hole when his head exploded. What is going to happen when Lord English dies???</p><p>What a great flash!</p>
