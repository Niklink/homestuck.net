<p><span>CG: FINE YOU CAN THINK I&rsquo;M A FUCKING DOUCHE AND MAYBE I AM BUT HERE&rsquo;S THE FACT, IDIOT.</span> <br/>CG: I&rsquo;VE ALREADY HAD LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. <br/>CG: IN THE FUTURE. I MEAN YOUR FUTURE. <br/>CG: I&rsquo;VE KIND OF BEEN WORKING BACKWARDS HERE FOR A WHILE.  <br/>CG: AND IT&rsquo;S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING. <br/>CG: EVERY TIME I GO FURTHER BACK YOU KNOW LESS AND LESS, AND YOU DON&rsquo;T REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID BECAUSE IT HASN&rsquo;T HAPPENED YET. <br/>CG: AND I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF A LOT. <br/>CG: AND I&rsquo;M GETTING PRETTY FUCKING SICK OF IT.</p>

Poor guy just can&rsquo;t get how linear time works.</p>
