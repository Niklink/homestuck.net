<p>!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Does this mean she made a new Gl'bgolyb, or somehow resurrected the old one? That&rsquo;s crazy! And it kept glubbing, and killing off all the trolls! I wonder why. To punish her? Or perhaps to guide the events forward in a specific direction, one that doesn&rsquo;t involve trolls coming back?</p>
<p>I gather that the kids are going to make another new universe, since they&rsquo;re bringing their battlefield and hinting that significant things will happen there, but they also might establish a new troll population in the alpha kids&rsquo; universe, and since the troll kids want to reform their species, having other trolls would be detrimental. </p>
<p>Gl'bgolyb&rsquo;s motivation is such a mystery.</p>
