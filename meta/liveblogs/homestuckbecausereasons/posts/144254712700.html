<p>So, like, I started reading Homestuck on the advice of a friend, and was actually pretty annoyed that I liked it. Because it’s really long and that’s annoying. And then I reached the beginning of act 4 but I was so bored by the previous stuff that I quit.</p>

<p>Oh shit you guys, it’s the two year anniversary of when I started liveblogging Homestuck. Damn.</p><p>Couldn’t be happier that I did, too. Thanks, PAST Homestuckbecausereasons [PHBR] 2 YEARS AGO.</p>
