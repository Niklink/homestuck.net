<h2>Here's an excerpt I forgot to share with you of a post Andrew made after that "Begin Intermission 2" LE reveal. (p1) Why’s LE honking like Gamzee??? If you’re prepared to be very literal, you might believe LE’s honking is a symptom of Gamzee’s influence in some way, due to time shenanigans or what have you. Examined logically, it’s the other way around. On LE’s arrival, he releases the vast honk Gamzee’s religion foretold. LE has always been around influencing troll culture from the start…</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming this is another case of Hussie offering theories rather than answers? The English language can be fuzzy.</p>
<p>The latter seems more likely. It could be related, but the stuff Gamzee did was only tangentially related to honking&ndash;that is, the clown doll and Cal. </p>
<p>However, after seeing Cal move around a lot under the influence of black flashes now in at least two places (I remember on the meteor, and now with Dirk, could have happened before that too), and the fact that call was Doc Scratch&rsquo;s ectobiological father, it could be because of Cal.</p>
<p>It could also be both, due to the whole cause-effect loops that go on everywhere. Chicken or the egg thing. </p>
