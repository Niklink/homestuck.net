<p>Poor Vriska. </p>
<p>I really love her characterization and how she&rsquo;s written. It slowly becomes more and more apparent that she isn&rsquo;t evil, and it&rsquo;s clear that she&rsquo;s under so much stress she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Even this. She&rsquo;s a scared, confused kid, and she killed a friend out of rage, and now she feels terrible about feeling guilty, which makes it super hard for her to be moral at all, much less how when she was younger.</p>
