<p>Oh man, Aradia, baby. I didn&rsquo;t realize/remember she knew about her predecessor being Lord English&rsquo;s handmaid. That&rsquo;s got to be a royal mindfuck. </p>
<p>So the Horrorterrors have been keeping ghosties alive. Or existing. I suppose since they can see into the future, at least in some capacity, they would be preparing for the eventuality of Lord English coming after them, and would prepare by making sure Vriska would have a Navy of ghosts to distract him with. And also it is necessary to ensuring the continuation of reality. So the purpose of the ghosts all along was to be exterminated by Lord English. Makes sense, otherwise they&rsquo;d end up with a near infinity of ghosts.</p>
<p>I wonder if Aradia isn&rsquo;t gearing up for some kind of self-sacrifice. I just get the feeling.</p>
