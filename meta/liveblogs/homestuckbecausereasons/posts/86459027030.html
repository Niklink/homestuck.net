<h2>Trolls so far part two</h2>

<p>Sollux Captor, TwinArmageddons, Blue team leader?</p>
<p>Apparently he&rsquo;s just the coolest cat ever. He&rsquo;s a great hacker, but he has low self esteem and beats himself up over things. He sent Karkat some kind of super virus curse to show off, which Karkat of course activated. He&rsquo;s got two different colored eyes and likes to divide things up like that. He also has a &ldquo;mutant brain.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m really not sure what any of that means yet. He can also see into the future.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the kind of kid I want to wrap up in a blanket and hug, the poor guy. He&rsquo;s clever and powerful but he seems pretty unhappy and really unsure of himself, and very scared.</p>

<p>Tavros Nitram, AdiosToreador, Red team</p>
<p>Like half the reason I like this guy is just the writing. He&rsquo;s not an object lesson or pitiful, he&rsquo;s just a guy in a wheelchair. He&rsquo;s not just good with animals, he seems to have some kind of mind control over them. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing him joust in the medium! </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the trolls I&rsquo;ve met so far, or at least learned their names properly. I&rsquo;ve also met a floating girl who destroyed the frog (!) temple, and a lovely girl who is such a good friend she will take a chainsaw to Tavros&rsquo;s legs so he can get new robotic ones.</p>
