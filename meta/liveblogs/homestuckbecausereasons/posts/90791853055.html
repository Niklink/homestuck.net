<h2>idk how many people have told you yet but in the act 6 act 4 video it sounded like you thought the skeletons were consorts, they were actually underlings. also in that ask about how people think lord english went crazy from the green sun and used jadesprite as an example, when jadesprite was talking to jade said that she couldn't stop staring at the green sun and it hurt to look at it</h2>
<p>(Thanks to everyone else who submitted similar asks, btw! So hard to pick one to answer!)</p>
<p>You’re right, it makes way more sense for them to be underlings than undead consorts. Eugh, poor things, they’re literally just bones without prototyping? Man, Dirk, why couldn’t you have thrown some pillows at the Kernelsprites while you were flying around rapping and resurrecting beautiful ladies?</p>
<p>I guess I need to go back and look at Jadesprite&rsquo;s stuff again. I assumed it was all just her being super upset about coming back from the dead. But if the Green Sun is really fucking over Lord English, that makes Doc Scratch feel a bit more&hellip;sinister, to me.</p>
