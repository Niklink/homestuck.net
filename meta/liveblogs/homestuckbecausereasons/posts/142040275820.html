<p>This is another upd8 that’s fairly light on stuff to analyze.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="170" data-orig-width="1116"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_o4xi5tXGJg1qj3pg6_1280.png" data-orig-height="170" data-orig-width="1116"/></figure><p>So&hellip;what has Jade really fucked up, so far? Aside from her time as Grimbark Jade, she hasn’t really made worse mistakes than anyone else. Am I forgetting something? I probably am but it also seems like Terezi is being unfair to Jade (like everyone else!). </p><p>I’m bummed that we skipped over the end of the “how did you tell your friends” conversation&hellip;but now that I think about it, of course we didn’t get it. It’s pointless to see it laid out, because we’re going to actually see Dave come out. I mean, as a gay girl, I want to hear Dirk’s coming out story. Coming out stories are important to us. I want to see Dave have his fears about coming out allayed. But it’s also unnecessary, because we’ve seen enough of Dirk’s childhood to know the shape of his coming out, and we know the shape of what he’s going to say. The actual conversation is more fit for a fanfic than the canon. But&hellip;I still wanted to see it.</p><p>BUT this upd8 was really well done. I love how it’s paced. I love how the images of the Jacks juxtapose with the quotes from the Davesprite convo. And I could write about how we’ve got an interesting parallel between the Game Over thing (where John used time travel to correct the mistakes of <strike>everyone else</strike> Terezi) and the Davesprite creation (where Dave used time travel to correct the mistakes of <strike>John</strike> Dave), but fuck that, lets just appreciate how awesome and fun this upd8 was.</p><p>Also I was so ridiculously wrong about expecting a Jack/Jack confrontation before the Strider/Jack one. Soooo wrong. But this is way more exciting!</p>
