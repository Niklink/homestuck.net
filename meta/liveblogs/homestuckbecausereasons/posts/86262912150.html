<p>CG: REALLY THERE&rsquo;S NOTHING MORE TRAGIC THAN THESE NULL SESSIONS FULL OF KIDS ENTERING THE GAME AND FULFILLING SOME COSMIC DESTINY SHIT JUST TO GET WIPED OUT AND LEAVE BEHIND AN EMPTY POINTLESS INCIPISPHERE FOR ALL ETERNITY.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder if the trolls have interacted with other groups. How would CG know about the other groups, much less care, if they hadn&rsquo;t? </p>
<p>Also kind of not surprised that John and Jade are siblings, and so are Rose and Dave. It seemed kind of likely that they would be family. Although this does make me wonder, because the dream selves of either set are together on Prospit or Derse, and Rose said that thing to Dave about him being a moon prince. Maybe the four are going to take the place of the abdicated White Queen and King, and the late Black Queen and King. The numbers fit perfectly, as does the family relations.</p>
<p>Especially since CG said that Jack was the big difference between the troll game and the human one, and Jack was the cause of the abdications and deaths. </p>
<p>And Nanna and Grandpa were siblings, too, but maybe adoptive siblings? </p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the frog meteor with the flashback of Nanna and Grandpa and a Derse agent being so kind as to accidentally throw copies of Sburb into a time flower thing, so that Jade could get them later. </p>
