<p>tbh I am getting really bored of having Jack Noir as the antagonist. Okay, Bec!Jack is kind of awesome, and he&rsquo;s more interesting since he has the whole loyalty to Jade thing going on. But at this point I just want to meet a new villain. I think that&rsquo;s why I wanted destroy Skaia/the game to be a thing, even if now we know that&rsquo;s not possible. I figure Lord English will be the villain eventually, but Jack showing up again is just kind of meh.</p>
