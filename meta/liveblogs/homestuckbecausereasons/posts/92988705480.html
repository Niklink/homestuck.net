<p>Alphacrimson and I decided that I am a Rogue of Light. Light because I love information, getting it and giving it to people. Heck, I want to be a teacher, even. I want to get all of the knowledge, and disseminate it to everyone possible. While being overworked and underpaid and probably getting yelled at by parents. I can&rsquo;t imagine what my planet would be, Halloworthless. I don&rsquo;t know how to come up with that. My strife specibus would totally be bookkind. As for my sprite! I originally thought I would toss in my laptop, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Preferably something useful to me, but harmless for prototyping the enemy.</p>
<p>I would totally end up dead like 15 minutes after booting up Sburb though. The timeline doesn&rsquo;t even fit, but I would manage it.</p>
