<h2>Basically, Sexuality isn't a thing that exists for Trolls, Matesprits are close enough to human romance to be identified as such, Kissmesitude is romantic hate/rivalry, moirails are non-sexual life-partners/personal therapists, and auspisticism is like a cockblocking relationship counselor.  Also, since it isn't directly mentioned in the comic; Kanays has a "fetish" for the female gender.  She can still be attracted to boys but prefers girls, this is as close to being a lesbian as trolls can get</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Troll gender is interesting; The actual Trolls are all genetically male, physically hermaphrodites(primary sexual characteristics), and culturally(secondary sexual characteristics) the same gender as their Lusus. With the Mother Grubs taking the role of the female when it comes to actual reproduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing how sex works for trolls makes everything make so much more sense! So basically the trolls themselves act as male partners, providing sperm analogues and maybe egg analogues, and the mother grubs are basically the uterus. And it takes four trolls to reproduce. I am such a nerd, I basically now want a troll biology textbook so I can figure out how all this works. Like does the mother grub contribute genetic material as well, and possibly organelles like the mitochondria, the way Earth mothers do, or is she more of an incubator? </p>
<p>This reminds me somewhat of the Lilith&rsquo;s Brood tetrology, where the alien species reproduces via a male and a female who give genetic material to an ungendered/third gender who mixes them together and impregnates the female. IIRC. </p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
