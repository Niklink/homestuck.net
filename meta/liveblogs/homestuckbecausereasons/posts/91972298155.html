<p>Aradia deserves some kind of award for dodging questions.</p>
<p>Except I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s actually dodging the question, I think she&rsquo;s just landed in that rare place between being callous and cavalier about other people&rsquo;s deaths and accepting them. She cares, but she&rsquo;s also not going to let the inevitable upset her, and she&rsquo;s not necessarily going to judge Vriska, Aranea, and Meenah for being enthusiastic about what they have to do.</p>
<p>And honestly I can&rsquo;t much blame Vriska for protecting herself against sympathizing with all the ghosties. Lord English is the kind of villain that justifies extreme measures, so if she wants to convince herself that all those Nepetas don&rsquo;t count, that&rsquo;s okay. Mostly. Not all of us can be as chill as Aradia.</p>
