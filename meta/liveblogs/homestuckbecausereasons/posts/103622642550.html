<p>Anybody thought about how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory">miasma theory</a> applies to the special stardust glitches? The miasma theory was basically that certain illnesses were caused by &ldquo;bad air&rdquo; or particles suspended in the air. This is why plague doctors wore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor">those ridiculous masks</a>. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the cure for such diseases was thought to be good air&ndash;which is why tuberculosis patients would be sent to various &ldquo;clean&rdquo; locations&ndash;but I heard those things in English class (miasmas were often referenced by people like Shakespeare and used as a metaphor) and can&rsquo;t find anything to back it up right now. But if it were true, John would basically be providing the good air that clears out the miasma.</p>
<p>Also the whole blow in your cartridge to fix it thing, but it&rsquo;s 1:30am here and I know if I put off making this post till morning I&rsquo;ll never make it so.</p>
