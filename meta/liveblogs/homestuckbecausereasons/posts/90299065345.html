<p>So Caliborn/Lord English has possibly not slept since that flash. I am guessing, because I like to think that if Calliope had the body again, she would do whatever she could to prevent her brother from destroying everything. It would  explain why Lord English looks so fucking unhinged all the time&ndash;much more unhinged than little Caliborn did, although he was a scary motherfucker in his own right. Being immortal and invincible is probably enough to drive a person crazy, anyway.</p>
<p>Although that&rsquo;s kind of mundane, I&rsquo;m thinking about whether Lord English could be pure evil driven insane, what with the connecting imagery between him and <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Giygas">Giygas</a> of Earthbound. </p>
