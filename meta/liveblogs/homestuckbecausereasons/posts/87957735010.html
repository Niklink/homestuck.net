<p>TT: What exactly does the Scratch do, then? <br/>It resets the game. <br/>TT: Oh. <br/>TT: That&rsquo;s it? <br/>Yes. <br/>TT: Then, <br/>TT: We all start from the beginning again? When John entered? <br/>No. <br/>The release of temporal energy will be quite massive. <br/>This is a hard reset. It will reboot the conditions in your universe well before you began playing the game. <br/>You will have lived different lives after the reset. The different initial conditions will ideally lead to a more favorable scenario in the new session. <br/>Unfortunately, you will have no memory of anything that has happened in the session you are in now. <br/>TT: What will happen to us? Everyone in this session now? <br/>You will all cease to exist completely if you remain here during the Scratch. <br/>TT: This seems familiar. <br/>TT: It reminds me of when Dave and I were trapped in the doomed timeline, and he left to change the past. <br/>TT: The timeline ceased to exist, along with my dream self, who in a way became merged with my dream self of this timeline. I kept some of her memories. <br/>TT: Is the situation similar? <br/>Similar, but more severe. <br/>Since this timeline will undergo such a violent upheaval, such a merger of memory cannot happen. <br/>You will be resigned to absolute oblivion. <br/>Unless you can discover a way to preserve yourselves. <br/>But it&rsquo;s not really my place to advise you on that. <br/>After you have dealt with the Scratch and the sun, what happens to you is not any of my business.</p>

<p>I would find this more worrisome, except at this point I&rsquo;m assuming that the kids get into the trolls&rsquo; world to protect themselves from obliteration. </p>
<p>A hard reset is really interesting, but I thought the kids&rsquo; session was never meant to be successful anyway. I guess that could be determined after the creation of the universe, though.</p>
