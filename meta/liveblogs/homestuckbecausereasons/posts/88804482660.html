<h2>These Lord English things around Jake have got to be some kind of joke, right? It's all just too heavyhanded, right??  But then again, try rereading p=004790...  "EB: in my foolishness, i came very close to prototyping your grandpa. GG: D: GG: john, try to be more careful! EB: we very nearly had to face our grandfatherly paradox-dad as a last boss. EB: that would probably be the worst case scenario. "</h2>
<p>If only you could see my face right now! The look of gleeful surprise! (Seriously, I need a word for this emotion, because I am feeling it constantly with this thing.)</p>
<p>Oh man, I had totally just assumed that having to fight one&rsquo;s grandfather/dad would be hard emotionally, and now realizing that Jake is somehow related to Lord English (or something), I am just squeeing at the idea! So excited to find out what all of this means!</p>
