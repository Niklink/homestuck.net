<h2>Your liveblogging was fast, so by following you I would have missed heaps and spammed my dashboard. It was so great though! I gave your tumblr page a dedicated tab for months that I could refresh multiple times a day and see new posts. I didn't see you answer some big questions though, did you enjoy homestuck? What was good and what was bad? How would you recommend it to a friend with lots of free time? Most memorable quote? Favourite fanfic? Anyway, thank you so much for your liveblogging! :D</h2>
<p>Thanks for answering! I am so glad you enjoyed my liveblog~~ I&rsquo;m totally blushing so hard that you gave me a dedicated tab, that&rsquo;s so awesome. </p>
<p>That makes sense, why you would follow me after I finished. I seriously ate my way through Homestuck (and it was delicious). I really loved Homestuck, I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic piece of storytelling with amazing dialogue and really solid worldbuilding. The pacing after the fourth act is fucking amazing. I&rsquo;m really impressed how Hussie could keep cutting between multiple storylines and characters and not cause cliff-hanger whiplash (see: Lost, which was kind of Homestuck-esque except where Homestuck is awesome and makes better than good on its promises, Lost was a terrible disappointment that laughed at you for expecting anything of it). </p>
<p>I definitely would recommend it. I&rsquo;ve tried to but none of my friends are biting. I think it&rsquo;s weakest point is the beginning, when the art isn&rsquo;t as good and it&rsquo;s really directionless. <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/mfTsrmJsPbk0ctJA9APRrTA">grimdarkthroes</a> told me that it would take like 20 hours to get through the beginning, to the good stuff, and I basically laughed at her, which seemed totally reasonable because I give most things about 10 minutes to catch my interest or I quit. I have awesome taste and they know it, but nobody trusts me on Homestuck. What can I say.</p>
<p>For the weak parts&hellip;I really disliked the jokes about puppet ass and cock, like, on a visceral level, and how those puppets and the other dolls looked. Just, ew, gross. A part of me also wants to complain a bit about the gender politics (eg the gender specific classes and what that means, that sort of thing) but considering the comic almost has a 50-50 male-female ratio and has lots of female-female relationships and has a non-exploitative lesbian couple, it seems like nitpicking. Also I suspect that we&rsquo;ll get better explanations as to why male tends to mean destructive while female means creative and why that&rsquo;s not like, sexist or gender prescriptive. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi karkat!&rdquo; is definitely the most memorable quote for me. I just&hellip;that conversation was the best conversation.</p>
<p>And for fics I&rsquo;ve really only read three. I loved loved loved Loophole, and then read Unwanted Free Ugly Troll, which I think suffered from not wanting anything too bad to happen to the characters itis, which is fine, y'know. But Loophole took the UFUT world and made it real. I also just finished Hemostuck, as I mentioned, which I also love, even if it made me really like Eridan. And it made kismesisitude make sense. I&rsquo;ve got more recommendations saved but the lengths keep freaking me out. My askbox is always open for more suggestions, too!</p>
