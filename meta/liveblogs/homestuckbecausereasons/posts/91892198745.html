<p>So she&rsquo;s obviously talking about lil Cal being the juju Caliborn/Lord English was confined to, but&hellip;something about the wording and what we&rsquo;ve seen so far doesn&rsquo;t make sense. She says his &ldquo;being was inexplicably&rdquo; confined, not that he himself was confined. Couple that with the fact that we know Lord English was, in some way, living inside Doc Scratch, and that we saw Caliborn potentially using lil Cal to possess Jack Noir. </p>
<p>So maybe like, Caliborn&rsquo;s soul wound up in lil Cal, and that&rsquo;s why Lord English seems crazy. </p>
