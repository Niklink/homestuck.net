<p>Prediction: The treasure Vriska found is going to attract Lord English. Well, okay, this idea is based on how together Lord English is, and he seems kiiiiind of like a mindless killing machine a lot of the time. But. He does seem to be able to show up in significant places, like Hussie&rsquo;s house, and he seems to have arranged it so ANOTHER Jack will arrive at LoFaF with his weapon/staff, so hunting down the ultimate weapon against him (maybe) is probably within his capabilities. Of course, the silly goose will then activate the weapon ability of it.</p>
<p>Which is&hellip;fuck, I don&rsquo;t even have a guess. We know that it exploits the in-universe physical laws. Probably has something to do with granting LE the immortality that cherubs have during mating, but probably a lot more than that. </p>
<p>Time to read some theories from other people, I guess.</p>
