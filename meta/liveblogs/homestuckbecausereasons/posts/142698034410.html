<p>So, today’s upd8 is another light one, although to me this signals that not only is there danger on the lilypad, this could go bad too.</p><p>I was wrong about the next upd8 being about Jane hugging Dad as well and that’s a bummer. I’m still holding out hope that when we get to tomorrow, we’ll see it, but that seems more wishful thinking than anything. I mostly feel guilty about judging people for assuming that we wouldn’t get the hug. Sorry guys, I was so wrong! </p><p>So LOTR references, yay! The fact that we’re seeing it makes me think that they’re going to get thwarted somehow. The formerly Bec Noir, now just Jack Noir, seems to be out of the picture, but we have both Lord English and Condy (probably) active still, and people have pointed out that the Draconian Dignitary hasn’t been seen in a while. There may be something unforeseen that could happen as well. Or maybe we’re just rolling up to see the birth of a Genesis Frog and everything there will be fine, and guys, I am <i>terrible at predicting things</i>. </p><p>Also the handholding up the volcano is SO CUTE. </p><p>Once again, I feel like PM’s face is a refrance to something that I’m not getting. I expect after I make a cup of tea and sit back down I will have 20 asks telling me that it’s something terribly obvious. </p><hr><p>I’ve heard rumors that 4/13′s update will be dropping tonight. If it drops before 2AM I’m just gonna probably make a big coffee and decide to pull an all-nighter because fuck doing a repeat of the day after Collision! Who is with me? (Also if yes, people should Skype me at cthaehsvoice or AIM me at outbroadwaystyle or, I guess, gmessage me at foxtailbarley, why not include all of them. Srsly feel free to hit me up at 4AM tonight I will BE THERE and we can all have feels together.) <br/></p><p>Actually is there a Skype group for freaking out about Homestuck feels? There should be. I know Reddit and 4chan do stuff but Reddit and 4chan both freak me out, that’s why I tumblr. </p>
