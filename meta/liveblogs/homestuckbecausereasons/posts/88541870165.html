<h2>Skaia was never the ultimate enemy? It was originally the Black King Skaia is the home of the Battlefield. While it does destroy species in its bid to protect itself, that's a necessity in the context of the game, and Skaia is an integral part of the Ultimate Alchemy. I really don't get why so many fans seem to hate Skaia so much. I mean, Rose started hating Skaia while she was under the influence of the Horrorterrors (who themselves oppose Skaia), and look where that's gotten her.</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know at what point the Horrorterrors started influencing her to the point of controlling her opinions, but I was basing my opinion on Skaia on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003842">the end of Rose&rsquo;s gameFAQ</a>. This is the second ask I&rsquo;ve gotten disagreeing, so maybe I missed the point somewhere? </p>
<p>But Rose also talked in general about <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004582">fucking up the game</a>, so even if the enemy isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Skaia&rdquo; I want to see the enemy be the game.</p>
