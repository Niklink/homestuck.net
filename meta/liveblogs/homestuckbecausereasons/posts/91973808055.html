<p>Is this a hero of time thing? I figure she&rsquo;s talking about time loops, and Dave did seem pretty chill about the alternative Daves&hellip;But then Dave is chill about everything. Maybe it&rsquo;s a result of her having to sacrifice all the Aradiabots to beat the black king. Aradia basically had to orchestrate a mass suicide of her selves, so she probably already dealt with the moral issues there. </p>
