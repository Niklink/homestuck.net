<p>So I definitely think we’re being punked now. Hussie is just toying with us. I bet the rest of these updates are just going to be pictures. And they’re great pictures! But I reeeeeeeally want dialog. </p><p>Act 7 is probably going to be huge, clear your calendars now. I mean, it wouldn’t make sense for it to be anything but huge, right? </p><p>Aaaaaanyway.</p><p>For some reason I love these pictures way more than yesterday’s? Maybe because yesterday was just everybody we expected to be healed being healed, and everybody we expected to meet up meeting up. I hadn’t been expecting a Ms Paint/(b1) Jack Noir meet up, or a Callie/Jade meet up! I wonder if it’s intentional that the two people doomed!Calliope said were pointless are now in the same place. </p><p>Also OH MAN Callie is so tiny! </p><p>And why, whyyyy, would Ms Paint rip a bandage from the top of her dress, rather than the long, pointless trail? I haven’t worn a lot of strapless dresses in my life, but in my experience that material is 1. pretty stiff and 2. important for holding the dress up. So. weird. </p>
