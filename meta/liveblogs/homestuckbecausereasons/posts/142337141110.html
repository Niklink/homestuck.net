<p>You may think just by looking at the image that this is supposed to be a joke or something. But no. As impressive as Dave killing Lord Jack and Roxy killing Condesce is, this motherfucker right here. Karkat Vantas outshone everyone in the update by taking down Clover.</p>
<p>Because lest you forget, Clover’s whole deal is probability manipulation. And not just some weeny baby level either. His luck is so absurd that he literally takes any chance of you hurting him and turns it to 0. You literally have a 0% chance of ever harming him. So much so that even a gun at point blank won’t do it. While he’s harmless in every other aspct, the little guy was literally made to be <b>unbeatable</b>.</p>
<p>And Karkat BEAT him. With a 0% chance of winning the fight, Karkat SOMEHOW caught Clover. He pulled off a feat that is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. He essentially said fuck you to the rules of reality and spat in the face of fate.</p>
<p>KARKAT BEAT CLOVER AND THE FACT THAT HE DID MAKES LITERALLY NO SENSE. THE BOY IS A GOD.</p>

<p>*salutes the glory that is Troll!Moses*<br/><br/>Not only that, but he stood up to Lord English and tried to kill him single handedly while everyone else thought he was insane! ;D </p>

<p>We can expect big things for Karkat in the future!</p>
