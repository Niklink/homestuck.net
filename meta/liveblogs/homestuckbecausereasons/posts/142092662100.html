<p>Oh man what a cool update that I have so little to say about again! Of course for me, “so little” is still a good few paragraphs.</p><p>How long was Vriska sitting there, waiting for the ghost army to arrive? I guess she would have heard them approaching, but now I’m imagining her like, stretched out on the sand with her palmhusk, waiting impatiently for them to arrive, and then jumping up and shaking off the sand and sitting down so she’ll look cool the moment they arrive. Or maybe just sitting there while her ass falls asleep, just in case Meenah has really good eyesight.</p><p><a href="http://chimeresnervaliennes.tumblr.com/post/142083572935/hes-here">Chimeresnervaliennes spotted Hussie spying on Vriska</a>! That’s so cool and I totally missed it. (I hope his presence isn’t actually important and is just a joke.)<br/></p><p>I’M SO EXCITED TO SEE THE LORD ENGLISH FIGHT! </p><p>FLASH BACK FLASH BACK FLASH BACK FLASH BACK!</p><p>Okay that term is meaningless in Homestuck but holy shit do you think we’ll see Caliborn interact with Yaldabaoth? I want to see players and their denizens so fucking much and we almost never see it (have we ever seen it, I think we just had the characters tell each other what happened afterward?). </p><p>TOMORROW IS GONNA BE GREAT.</p>
