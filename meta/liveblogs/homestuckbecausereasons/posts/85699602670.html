<p>Reflecting on stuff I read before:</p>
<p>Is it weird that I really want to know more about Rose&rsquo;s mom? <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002266">Is Rose right about her mom being a jerk</a>, or is she being a typical brat who assumes their parents don&rsquo;t actually love them? I hope it&rsquo;s the latter, personally. Maybe her mom just has no idea how to connect with her daughter, which would be adorable. Or maybe she really is passive aggressive and wants to always outdo her daughter. That would not be adorable. </p>
