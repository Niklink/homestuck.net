<h2>Which characters do you think have had the most character growth so far? Just in your opinion and stuff.</h2>
<p>Aaaaaaaah. That&rsquo;s a really good question. Because like, for most of the characters there&rsquo;s a really strong focus on their development, and since they&rsquo;re teens and we see them roughly over a three year period, there&rsquo;s a lot of developing they should do. Most of the characters I&rsquo;m thinking about who haven&rsquo;t changed much are the ones who haven&rsquo;t had much screen time lately. Eridan, Feferi, Nepeta, Equius&hellip;They all died and kind of just languished off screen. For everybody else, they&rsquo;ve had a lot of development, although to come up with a good analysis I&rsquo;d probably need to go back and look at where they started and where they are now, y'know? I&rsquo;m worried that my own biases are coloring my memory. For example, I want to say that it seems like Tavros hasn&rsquo;t developed very much, but that might be unfair. </p>
<p>I think Vriska has had some of the most development&ndash;she&rsquo;s dealt with a lot of her issues and spent a lot of time figuring out who she is and developing a moral compass. </p>
<p>The alpha kid arc was, more than anything really about them growing as people. John dealt with being an unintentional asshole, Roxy dealt with her alcoholism, Dirk with his self-hatred and being clingy, Jane with bottling up her opinions and emotions&hellip;</p>
<p>Hell, even Caliborn got a lot of development. He&rsquo;s learned team work and social skills&hellip;even if those social skills are not shooting Gamzee&hellip;</p>
