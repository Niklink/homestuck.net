<h2>About Vriska and Tavros's puzzles. It's implied that since the moment of Tavros's entry she's been sitting at her computer in her hive as his server, helping him lift stones into walls, instead of doing her own quest or at least something fun. I wonder if he ever thanked her for that or thought of how it looked from her perspective...</h2>
<p>Huh, that&rsquo;s interesting. I guess he kind of needed her to do that, since the hovercraft thing looks useful in terms of mobility, but not actually for doing that. Doubt he thanked her, though. And I doubt she&rsquo;s any good at expressing just what she&rsquo;s sacrificing, without being a jerk about it. Which is why I kind of love her.</p>
