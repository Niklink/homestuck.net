<p>Sooooooooooo. </p>
<p>Who else has started looking at their life through a Homestuck POV? </p>
<p>Not just for myself, I look at someone who is clearly trying to avoid solving issues they know they have, and I go, &ldquo;Damn, they would be so fucked in Homestuck.&rdquo; (Obvs BKEW has told me all about how what Skaia wants from you is that you deal with your personal failings to succeed.) And then I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Go me, being in therapy all the time, dealing with my weaknesses, trying to be a better me.&rdquo; Not that it&rsquo;s just good for my own happiness and makes me a better citizen and potentially a better teacher when I get to that, my type of depression makes it kind of hard to care about those, but reframing it in terms of Homestuck is so much easier.</p>
<p>Also I think about how to be a better Rogue of Light, but everybody thinks about how to excel at their classpect, right? :D</p>
