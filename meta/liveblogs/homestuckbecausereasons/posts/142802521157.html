<p>I’m super excited to reread and liveblog (although obviously with way less updates than in the first reads), because Homestuck is so great and I love it so much, and even looking up stuff to verify my complaints about Act 7 makes me love it all the more and all over again!</p><p>But it has to wait until I can read without immediately cringing and getting all painful nostalgic for ~what might have been~. Or it’s going to be nothing but “THIS WAS SO GREAT WHY DIDN’T HUSSIE WANT TO INCLUDE IT IN ACT 7???????” and nobody wants to read that.</p><p>If anybody has ideas for our liveblog rereads, or is starting one soon, plz drop me an ask! </p>
