<h2>Just wait until you get to the [SPOILERS REMOVED] hey, what the--oh, stupid antispoilery thing. Okay. NONSPOILER VERSION--Just wait until you get to the specifics of why they're talking about "reds" and "moirallegience". It's really cool, AND really complicated. Kind of like, well, everything Homestuck, I guess.</h2>
<p>I thought reds was about blood castes but now I&rsquo;ve read a bit more and stuff like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CA: you dont wwant to be our auspistice cause you dont wwant to get locked into that sort of relation wwith her i can respect that<br/>GA: No Thats Not It<br/>CA: yeah it is your real feelins run pretty awwful RUDDY methinks evverybody knowws it<br/>CA: especially that assblood karkat he and me havve you so pegged about that its upright silly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>makes me doubt that a bit, especially if we&rsquo;re talking about Kanaya being attracted to Vriska, who is pretty decidedly not redblooded.</p>
<p>I am excited to get to whatever those spoilers were~ So excited. </p>
