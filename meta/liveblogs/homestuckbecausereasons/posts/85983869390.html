<p>God, guys, I feel so dumb for not realizing that the trolls might be fucking with John and trying to get him screwed over or killed. I mean, they're <em>trolls. </em>It&rsquo;s right there in the name. I hope I&rsquo;m not this optimistic and trusting in real life or I&rsquo;m in for a world of hurt. Also, wtf John, why were you so trusting? I hope that doesn&rsquo;t get you hurt later on. Like of course you&rsquo;re not supposed to just jump way ahead and kill some big monster in its sleep. </p>
<p>And apparently now Dave can time travel? And has arms and is tall? I&rsquo;m actually more concerned with the tall thing than the time travel. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned for alternative timeline Rose. I hope she&rsquo;s not stuck out there in some hellscape. I can&rsquo;t even deal with the alternate timeline stuff right now, too much is going on. Damn. </p>
