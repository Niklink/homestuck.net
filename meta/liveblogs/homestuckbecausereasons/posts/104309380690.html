<p>SON OF A BITCH, I only JUST NOW got this</p>
<p>Giant blank space? Time is stopped for as long as they want? Roxy training to use her powers better?</p>
<p>It’s Dragon Ball Z’s FUCKING <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a>. And you know Andrew did it intentionally because of that <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=007837">reference to it</a> Dave made earlier (pic above). FUCK.</p>
<p>This parallel only just occurred to me but I’m sure a lot of you thought of it first and are laughing your asses off right now.</p>

<p>Are you <strong><em>KIDDING me</em></strong></p>
<p>He saved the hyperbolic time chamber for right when the comic went <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtpyeLxVkI">over p=009000</a>, <strong><em>god FUCKING DAMMIT</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for that matter there’s another “<a href="http://paradoxspace.com/quality-time/6">hyperbolic time chamber</a>&ldquo; reference that Hussie’s made recently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah right, he did the writing on that one! “Hyperbolic Playtime Chamber”… I had a feeling there was one I was missing, dammit, that explains it.</p>

<p>Hello yes I am a DBZ nerd and the hyper gravity chamber and the hyperbolic time chamber were two very different things. The gravity chamber was basically just a room existing in regular time with a machine that controlled gravity, and the time chamber was basically a different dimension that had slightly higher gravity but the most important thing was that one year in it=one day in the real world.</p>
<p>Not to say it&rsquo;s not a reference, just that Dave&rsquo;s reference and this reference would be to two different things. Of course Dave&rsquo;s reference could just be enough to bring up DBZ period but I am a nerdy pedant.</p>
