<h2>i just caught up on 80% of this blog in one go because i've been travelling/having exams since june and i am so full of homestuck nostalgia wow,, as for opinions, im not sure how far you've dwelled into the music albums but vriska's theme from Colours and Mayhem A has a morse code message in it and there's still fandom controversy over its meaning, any thoughts?</h2>
<p>Oh my gosh, you marathoned my liveblog? </p>
<p>Apparently it had SOS and/or some similar distress signal. I&rsquo;m not really very good with analyzing music or with morse code, but a lot of what Vriska does seems like a cry for help to me, so&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t find any good discussion or explanation on it, myself.</p>
