<p>Somewhere along the line I stopped being annoyed at how awesome Homestuck is. Now that I&rsquo;m caught up I&rsquo;m mostly just basking in joy over the great writing and storytelling and I&rsquo;m so glad I read it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also kind of weird, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m not going insane, right? Homestuck is a ridiculous comic novel thing, but it&rsquo;s also so. fucking. good.</p>
<p>Also now that I&rsquo;m done with it, I want to evangelize to people, but it took me months of dedicating most of my free time to reading it, and I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to do that to my friends. </p>
