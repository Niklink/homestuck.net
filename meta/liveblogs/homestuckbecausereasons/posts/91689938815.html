<p>I want to form the Committee of People for the Hugging of Sollux. Because boy does he need a hug. Where is Feferi? She needs to hug him, poor bb.</p>
<p>At first I was going to say that Sollux is adorable because he has problems just like disabled people, except NOTHING like them, and then I started imagining people telling Sollux to just eat fish oil to fix his eyes. Which I would love to see. And then I went looking to see if there were &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask about my disability&rdquo; shirts out there, because I know disabled people who said they would like something like that, but all I got was Homestuck stuff.</p>
<p>Which is totally reasonable, that&rsquo;s an awesome line.</p>
