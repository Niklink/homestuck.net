<p>So my dearest Milli ( @grammarmancer or her homestuck blog @homestuckbecausereasons )traded watching/reading homestuck/naruto so I am now 1000 pages in and apparently people wanna know my thoughts and I’m a sucker for attention. So I made a blog and through in Naruto because why the hell not. I’ll figure out tags to mark each clearly…later. Right now this is just Homestuck.<br/>
 So. My feelings on homestuck…<br/>
 I like it! Jon and Jade are my favorite (and I actually have enough characters around now that isn’t like picking your favorite foot.) but I p much like everyone right now.<br/>
 There are a lot of interesting plot things going on. I modded RP games during the biggest wave of homestuck fandom, so read a lot if apps and know a lot without context, so I’m trying not to over think things so as not to spoil (respoil?) myself by triggering off memories and just sorta…going with the flow. Which is nice and enjoyable.<br/>
 The only thing I dont really get is how much I was told the beginning sucks. Because I do enjoy it, I’m half excited for “better” to come, and half worries that what’s “better” won’t be my cuppa. Still, we just started meeting really trolls so I’m excited.<br/>
 And I am totally open to asks (about either fandom, I’ll  do a starter Naruto post…later.) I know a lot of Homestuck spoilers but I’m trying not to so probably avoid that.<br/>
 I’ll also try to get an icon that’s not my cat eating broccoli too but you know whatever.</p>

<p>Hey guys! Here is my friend’s Homestuck and Naruto blog. You should follow it. </p><p>I’m pretty sure Act 5 will be your cuppa. It gets a lot plottier, stuff starts happening faster, and you get the real cool fourth wall breaking and time travel stuff then! It’s not that it’s really different, it’s just that Hussie stopped taking commands at that point and just started writing the story normally, so the pacing improves a lot! That sort of thing. Same sense of humor, same characters, all that. </p><p>Act 5 is one of the finest things ever written, IMHO.</p>
