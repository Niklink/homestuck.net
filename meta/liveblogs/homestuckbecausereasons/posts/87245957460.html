<h2>What're your top... let's say eight characters so far? Also, since you're not into shipping that much, what characters do you like to see interacting the most?</h2>
<p>In no particular order: Rose, Terezi, John, Vriska, Kanaya, Sollux, Karkat and Feferi. Aradia got knocked off the list because she&rsquo;s such a fatalistic downer. Which I don&rsquo;t blame her for, I mean, it makes perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s just not fun to read. If she had more to do, other than feel like everything is pointless, she would knock Feferi or Karkat off the list. </p>
<p>I love Kanaya and Rose so so so so much. </p>
<p>I also like Vriska and John, and Terezi and Dave, although maybe not romantically. I think it&rsquo;s going in a romantic/flushed direction for them, but eh romance (except Kanaya and Rose). </p>
<p>And I really enjoy John and Karkat&rsquo;s interactions, since they&rsquo;re usually ridiculous and hilarious, not to mention now John is trolling Karkat and that&rsquo;s beautiful and perfect. And Equius/people who give him orders.</p>
