<h2>Well, there *is* one little fact that's interesting: remember Gamzee's whole "motherfucking jury" bit during confrontation between Terezi and Vriska, and how he has the heads of all the recently dead trolls? Well, he has all the high-blooded trolls on the "table" with the lowblood Tavros on the floor, which is in line with his new subjugglator way of thinking, but there's something else... something the former trolls have in common with the alpha kids...</h2>
<p>Apparently Hussie said that Tavros was on the floor because his horns were too big for the table…</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Q: &ldquo;Speaking of Tavros, did Gamzee set his head on the floor as an insult?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">A: Mainly his horns were too big to fit on the jury table.</p>
<p class="p2">It&rsquo;s kind of like when you&rsquo;re shopping, and you have to buy a huge thing like a giant bag of kitty litter or whatever, so you have to slide it in the space under the cart.</p>
<p class="p2">Basically what I&rsquo;m saying is, if Gamzee carried all the dead troll heads in a shopping cart, he would put Tavros&rsquo; head in the bottom thing.</p>
