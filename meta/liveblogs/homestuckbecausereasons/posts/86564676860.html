<p>Time to meet Equius Zahhak! He bosses Nepeta around and is apparently Slytherin. Because he&rsquo;s obsessed with blood purity.</p>
<p>Also he seems kinda kinky. Which I dislike saying because again, they&rsquo;re kids, but he got Gamzee to boss him around, kind of, and it totally relaxed him. So, uh, the S&amp;M character I guess. Also, he&rsquo;s super strong, in like, an absurd way. </p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the guy who is gonna make Tavros&rsquo;s legs and then not destroy them, like he does for every other robotic thing he makes. I assume he&rsquo;s also not going to destroy Aradia&rsquo;s new robot body, but he might, if she rejects him. Because he&rsquo;s in love with her and she&rsquo;s red blooded so he thinks she&rsquo;s like, blood-wise beneath him, and we all know how that kind of thing can end!</p>
