<p>Fucking finally, I have met all the trolls. So here&rsquo;s Erindan Ampora, who is some kind of like noble among trolls because his blood is so awesome or something? He wants to kill all the land-dwelling trolls, or at least that&rsquo;s what he keeps saying. He doesn&rsquo;t really mean it, since he&rsquo;s made friends with the other trolls. But hey, I&rsquo;ve been there. You say you&rsquo;re going to do something, and then you decide not to, but how are you going to admit that to anyone? Especially to yourself. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an asshole in the way most 12-year-olds are assholes&ndash;aside from the wanting to kill people part.</p>
