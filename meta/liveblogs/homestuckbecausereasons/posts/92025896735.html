<p>So, uh. I love Vriska and my heart is totally broken for her right now.</p>
<p>Obviously all this was super hard for her. She feels the deaths of her clone ghost friends. She&rsquo;s sacrificing her own morality and integrity to do what she knows she has to to stop Lord English, and John judges her because she&rsquo;s not properly fucked up about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he&rsquo;s the one who made her feel like a person while she was dealing with guilt over trying to be a good troll but also knowing deep down that killing Aradia, and all the other trolls she had to kill to feed her lusus, was wrong. I think she needed that validation to keep being a good person. She needed to know she wasn&rsquo;t beyond hope. And now based on an afternoon John says she might just be too far gone.</p>
<p>Also I see a parallel here between this and what Tavros did, refusing to kill her. She was going to die anyway, it was the right and necessary thing to do, but he opted to let her suffer because he didn&rsquo;t want to go through with it. And it&rsquo;s hard to kill your friend even if she&rsquo;s dying, just like it&rsquo;s hard to send ghosts to their deaths, but it has to be done. Those ghosts were going to die anyway, either because Vriska put them in Lord English&rsquo;s way to lead her to the weapon, or because Lord English found them on his own as he tore through the Furthest Ring destroying everything. But John wants to wonder about the morality about it, like maybe we should mope some, just so he can be sure she&rsquo;s not dangerous.</p>
