<p>OH MY GOD JOHN.</p>
<p>Rose was feeling bad about not going and seeking out her mom, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure John&rsquo;s choice to look for his dad is going to end horribly. He can&rsquo;t just hand the tumor off to who the fuck ever and trust that it will get to Rose. I mean, dramatic irony, he has no idea his dad is already dead, but that is still a terrible idea. Life and death shit here, John. Pay attention.</p>
