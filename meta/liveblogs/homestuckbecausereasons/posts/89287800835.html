<h2>Another question, btw:  What are your impressions of this UU character? What's their deal? (And I mean your impressions right NOW, not after you wait 'til naming.)</h2>
<p>I am incredibly suspicious! They&rsquo;re a troll, but they&rsquo;re just so nice and normal seeming, and that can&rsquo;t be right. I mean, there are certainly good trolls, but it was always underneath prickliness or just weirdness, and&ndash;if I am getting the timeline yet&ndash;it came out after they interacted a bit with the people. Having a troll that&rsquo;s just polite and proper all the time&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious that they&rsquo;re the Batterwitch/Condesce or related to her in some way, but of course if it&rsquo;s the 13th zodiac, Ophiacus, as the symbol we saw implies that wouldn&rsquo;t place it with pisces and aquarius, which is where the Condesce ought to be. </p>
<p>The symbol is also the one for Hermes, the Cadeceus, which is used as a medical symbol, which would be really interesting except that one seems to almost always have wings. HOWEVER Hermes is also associated with thieves, liars, and gamblers. (I could be wrong and it could be the Rod of Asclepius but that one has only one snake, so the Cadeceus is a lot more likely).</p>
<p>One last note before I talk about the actual character, their name uraniunUmbra basically means the shadow that Uranus would cast, specifically the darkest part. Whether that refers to the planet, the planet&rsquo;s significance in astrology, or the titan of Greek mythology isn&rsquo;t clear. </p>
<p>But enough symbolism and mythology! They use grey text, which associates them with the Sufferer and Karkat. But I have a sneaking suspicion that it&rsquo;s dissembling, rather than kinship. Revealing their place on the hemospectrum could give us a lot more information. I&rsquo;m guessing that they&rsquo;re not related to our trolls, since they imply that they&rsquo;re in a different session from the four we know&ndash;but again, that could be intentional misdirection. </p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m rereading their conversation with Jane, I&rsquo;m wondering if they couldn&rsquo;t be the Sufferer/Karkat&rsquo;s ancestor in the troll&rsquo;s first session, which was ultimately scratched. They&rsquo;ve set it up so they&rsquo;re beginning their session the same day Jane et al. are, but the personality super does not make sense. Also I get a distinctly feminine vibe, but that could just be from the formal speech.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of text to say&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know? I like them but I am assuming they will turn out to be totally evil. Or at least an antagonist of some sort.</p>
