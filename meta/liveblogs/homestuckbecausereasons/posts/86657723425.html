<h2>Oh, yeah, Kanaya's great for femshipping from the very first time we see her.  Compare--way back in acts 3 and 4--her reaction to the suggestion she likes Rose versus Tavros's reaction to the suggestion he likes Dave. (Tavros freaks out and denies it, Kanaya changes the subject.)  There was another liveblogger who, while reading acts 3 and 4, used to refer to Kanaya as "accidental lesbian" because up until she got to where you are she thought she was reading too much into Hussie's writing.</h2>
<p>Freaking out and denying it can be just as suspicious as changing the subject!</p>
<p>I totally missed that. Kanaya is pretty hard for me to read, or at least she was until I got enough information about her.</p>
