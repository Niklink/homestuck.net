<p>As much as I dislike the Auto Responder, generally, I can&rsquo;t get behind the idea of killing him. Not just because Dirk would feel terrible about it for forever. It&rsquo;s got to be rough, being a human personality with vast processing power and perfect recall, and having some amount of human emotion, without the ability to express it beyond words, being viewed by everyone you know (assuming auto responder doesn&rsquo;t have relationships outside of the alpha kids) as a shitty version of someone else&hellip;</p>
<p>Like he really needs to learn boundaries, and I mostly wish he would just fuck off, but he&rsquo;s still a person.</p>
