<p>Alright, I want to take a moment to talk about troll gender politics because I am a bit confused. See, I was told that troll women are tougher and stronger than troll men, which is why Karkat told Tavros to stop playing games for girls when Vriska threw Tavros off a cliff. But then why would Terezi here say that Dave will cry like a girl, unless it&rsquo;s to (not to overstate the point or get overly feminist here) imply that girls are weak and cry a lot?</p>
