<p>Sooooo, the trolls. I&rsquo;ll link to my original impressions, just because it was for fucking ever ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty bummed by the characters we lost in Horrorstuck. I get that they were the least useful for the plot, but I really liked <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86754447965/and-here-is-feferi-peixes-who-would-be-next-queen#notes">Feferi</a>, <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86480675065/nepeta-is-so-cute-i-do-not-know-what-to-do-with#notes">Nepeta</a>, and <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86564676860/time-to-meet-equius-zahhak-he-bosses-nepeta#notes">Equius</a>. I think we got a good ending for Equius, with him fusing with AR, and his whole speech to Nepeta about letting her get killed, but I&rsquo;m disappointed that Feferi and Nepeta never really got anything like that. I&rsquo;m hoping they&rsquo;ll show up again later but&hellip;I mean, maybe if BKEW is right and AR becomes Doc Scratch somehow, then Nepeta could show up and be useful for the plot, but that&rsquo;s about the only way I see it happening, and I don&rsquo;t like the AR/Scratch thing myself. </p>
<p>I forgot that I thought <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86644694640/aw-yeah-we-finally-meet-ga-for-real-aka-kanaya#notes">Kanaya</a> was like troll Jesus, since she was raised by a virgin mother (grub). Now I have a much better idea of what that means, but at the time it sounded Jesus-y, right? </p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86459027030/trolls-so-far-part-two">Tavros</a> and <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86483160010/the-vile-one-has-a-name-now-hiiiiiss-vriska-i#notes">Vriska</a> were my only really big opinion shifts. I said it elsewhere, but I basically started out loving Tavros and hating Vriska, and then came to love Vriska because she&rsquo;s not all bad. Tavros started to exasperate me because he&rsquo;s such a doormat.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86482149515/oh-i-really-like-aradia-too-shes-really-pretty#notes">Aradia</a> I don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion on either way. She was cool in the beginning, she&rsquo;s cool now, but I&rsquo;m not very interested in her. She&rsquo;s not one of the characters I want to read fanfic about just to see more of, at least. I wanted to know more about her internality when she was introduced, and now that I know more, she&rsquo;s still just really&hellip;detached. She&rsquo;s detached in an interesting way, what with her apparently loving the ghosties that are about to do but also being okay with them dying, but still.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86754432235/fucking-finally-i-have-met-all-the-trolls-so#notes">Eridan</a> just got more and more obnoxious as the story went on. He started out bad, and turned evil. The best part about him is he looks really cool, amirite?</p>
<p>I forgot how unhappy <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86459027030/trolls-so-far-part-two">Sollux</a> was when he was first introduced. The poor thing really set off my maternal instincts. I&rsquo;m glad that he&rsquo;s much happier now that he&rsquo;s gone blind, half died, and then half resurrected kind of. Now he&rsquo;s off flying around with Feferi, his matesprite, and Nepeta, who is so adorable she must make everyone&rsquo;s life better with her mere presence. Good for him.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86456718225/trolls-so-far-part-one">Karkat, Terezi, and Gamzee</a> all ended up on one post. For Karkat I went from finding him funny before Hivebent to exasperating as the main character of Hivebent, and now he&rsquo;s really one of my favorite characters. He&rsquo;s really angry, but he also really loves his friends. Terezi I found awesome then, and I still fucking love her. Enough said. Gamzee&hellip;</p>
<p>Gamzee had so much promise. I felt so bad that his lusus wasn&rsquo;t around to raise him. But I feel like I never get to see much of him directly. Other people will tell us what he&rsquo;s doing and why, but we don&rsquo;t get to see it the way we do with the other characters.  Almost everything we know about what he did in the three years they spent traveling was second hand from Karkat, Terezi, and a bit from Rose. We get some information about him from Caliborn, Karkat told us about what he did with the Black King, but mostly he&rsquo;s been slinking around in the shadows. It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me before how little he is actually present in the action, despite being constantly involved. It makes him a lot scarier, and a lot easier to underestimate. Hussie really is a masterful storyteller (and it&rsquo;s weird).</p>
