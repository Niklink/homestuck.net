<h2>I'm pretty sure Vriska is one of the most complex and detailed characters ever written-- she had to be, considering what Hussie intended to do with her. If you finish up before gigapause is up (which I'm pretty sure you definitely will at this pace), try rereading all the pesterlogs she's in. With all the knowledge you'll have of her and trolls in general at that point, you might catch a lot more of the subtleties. Or maybe I'm just crazy biased and reading into things too much! Who knows? :D</h2>
<p>I doubt you&rsquo;re just being biased! She seems very well written, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that I&rsquo;ll find once I look back. I really love her as a character, and it&rsquo;s really hard to judge most of the things she does considering she&rsquo;s 13. I imagine lots of 13-year-olds would act like her if they had super powers.</p>
