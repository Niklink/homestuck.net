And also John being willing to let all that slide makes him a shitty person too?? Why is this not a thing? </p><p>I have absolutely warmed to this epilogue, but I am really uncomfortable that the protagonist isn’t treating the genocide as seriously as he should be, and outside of pages and pages back, none of the characters seem concerned. Not to say that in order to believe that the writers are good people they need to make a morality play, but couple that with the Condesce on Earth history that got released as a teaser that blamed Jewish people for the Holocaust and I’m really disinclined to give the writers the benefit of the doubt, y’know? </p><p>No lie, I’m skipping a lot of this because I don’t care about Roxy finding herself if she’s not finding herself to be a person who finds genocide evil.</p>
