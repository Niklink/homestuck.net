<p>*patiently waits for BKEW to be around to link me to the deobfuscation of the Dirk/Dave conversation* It&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s a weekday, I know you&rsquo;re a busy guy!</p>
<p>Yay the mayor is saved, and that tedious conversation about evil Rose&rsquo;s evil heartbreak maybe never happened kind of! Er, did it happen? Do we have a branching timeline now, like if John isn&rsquo;t causing doomed timelines, can he break the alpha timeline into two&hellip;equally alpha timelines? One where the mayor was thrown off the ledge and one where he wasn&rsquo;t, but neither doomed? Or does this supplant the previous events? I have shit to do but I want to know more!</p>
<p>NONE OF THOSE WERE REAL QUESTIONS BTW DO NOT TELL ME PLZ THNX</p>
