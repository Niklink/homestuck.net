<p>Maaaan.</p><p>This update was cool but also kind of disappointing.</p><p>I’m trying not to think about all the stuff I want to see and all the questions I want answered, because if I do, then every page that doesn’t deal with it is a let down, and we can’t appreciate how cool it is to see Caliborn grinning up at Yaldabaoth (too bad the eye theory immediately got canned), or seeing the ruined but <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT5ACT1x2COMBO.php?s=6&amp;p=007722">no longer on fire</a> Prospit. </p><p>I really wouldn’t blame Hussie for not answering every question, because we all want Homestuck to end eventually, and we don’t want the ending of Homestuck to just be a massive breakdown of how all the mysteries worked. It’s okay not to have all the answers! But&hellip;I was expecting some dialogue today&hellip;</p><p>Note to self: Stop expecting things from Homestuck, just enjoy it.</p>
