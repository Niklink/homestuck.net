<h2><a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003424">Oh man so it looks like this is my first explanation of the post apocalyptic bunch!</a></h2>
<p>I am so excited! So now we know that they&rsquo;re on Earth, it&rsquo;s after the meteor bombardment caused by the Sburb game, and they&rsquo;re there to rehabilitate the planet, as well as helping John and co. via the computers. </p>
<p>It looks like there&rsquo;s supposed to be one exile for each of the four, but I can only remember three exiles so far. And of course I can&rsquo;t remember who goes with who to figure out if there&rsquo;s a significance to whether Dave or Jade doesn&rsquo;t have an exile. Or maybe the exiles double up or something, or I&rsquo;m forgetting one and it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>
<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s cool to finally see how they connect and see that the exiles weren&rsquo;t just some boring aside. I was getting annoyed every time we got dragged away from the main story to visit them and can town.</p>
