I was nervous that it’s like, the last season of a show that got stretched out too long and missed the chance for a satisfying finale. When the best writers had left or checked out. But this seems weird to me in a way that isn’t “Oh shit, Andrew Hussie really is done with Homestuck but also stringing us along anyway.” </p><p>Because the cherub meat/candy dichotomy is Meaningful, and that dichotomy is the choice that’s being offered to John, but also Callie and Roxy have been living together for years, so Callie really ought to know what humans eat. The rest of the page goes hard on the fact that it’s a Metaphor, but what a weird, offputting image to end on. </p>
