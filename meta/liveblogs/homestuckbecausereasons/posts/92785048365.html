<h2>also speaking of fan ideas and opinions, i totally think the arm thing is cooler reading archivally. theres more buildup to it. im at odds w most other long time fans abt this though. as someone who is reading archivally, do you think that it's cooler having seen the arms the whole time? jw</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure! I&rsquo;ve only gone through it archivally, so I have nothing to compare them to. I did enjoy it, though. It was something weird to be curious about, and it was a treat to see the arm show up in panels. BKEW can tell you about the times I would IM him to say that I found one. I was wondering for quite a while, so it did make for a serious holy shit moment when John stuck his hand through the juju hole thing. I liked it, but I can&rsquo;t say whether it&rsquo;s cooler or not.</p>
