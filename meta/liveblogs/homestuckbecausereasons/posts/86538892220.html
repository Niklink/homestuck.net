<p>AG: Oh really, well you seemed pretty excited a8out killing Tavros too. <br/>AG: And you even helped! So I guess that is how you work after all. <br/><strong>Not really. </strong><br/><strong>All I did was stand somewhere for a few minutes. </strong><br/><strong>I just gave you an opportunity to do something you wanted to do anyway. </strong><br/><strong>You hated him, remember?</strong> <br/>AG: I know I did! I still do, I guess. I dunno. <br/>AG: 8ut I was never gonna kill these people. They were like, off limits I guess? <br/>AG: These games were just supposed to 8e fun and serve no other purpose! <br/><strong>They were serving a very important purpose. </strong><br/>AG: Yeah ok, you getting off on talking a girl into killing her 8uddies sure is important! <br/>AG: Los8r.</p>

<p>(I bolded white text guy&rsquo;s text.) Oh shit I am starting to feel really bad and get really worried for Vriska. Like okay he&rsquo;s not forcing her to do anything but I get the feeling she&rsquo;s been groomed by him somehow and wasn&rsquo;t really doing it of her own volition. It seems very stereotypically abusive, y'know&ndash;manipulate someone into doing something and then telling them they did it because they chose to. A lot of gaslighting going on here.</p>
