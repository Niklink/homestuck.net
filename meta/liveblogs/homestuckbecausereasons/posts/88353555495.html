<p>I BET IT&rsquo;S THEIR ANCESTORS!</p>
<p>Although if it was, that would be really weird. Because their ancestors are creepy adults who are in some parts responsible for killing each other, which is a troll thing so I don&rsquo;t know what it would be like for a troll to meet someone they killed in the afterlife, and we really don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like for adult trolls to interact with child trolls, so everything is pure conjecture even if my guess is right. </p>
<p>Also I am suspicious of Jade&rsquo;s dream knowledge, since her dream self died. But maybe she&rsquo;s getting information from Feferi and them, and of course last we saw she was with Aradia, and Aradia knows things.</p>
