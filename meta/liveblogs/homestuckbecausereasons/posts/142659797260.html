<p>You can tell Homestuck is <i>fucking bullshit</i> any time you try to explain how Homestuck&rsquo;s fandom is being terrible, and you have to break out a fucking chart to explain the different timelines and different versions of characters just to say, &ldquo;People are arguing over whose grief is more legit and it&rsquo;s obnoxious.&rdquo;</p><p>Also I’m looking at the tags for my post about these upd8s and half the responses are “That makes sense, well put, thanks” and half of them are “ACT 7 IS TWO PAGES WHAT THEF UCK”</p><p><b>ANYWAY THIS UPD8!</b></p><p>It was super sweet, I grinned the whole time, I love it. I am still grinning over it. Jade’s face is perfect, everyone’s face is perfect. </p><p>The fact that it ends with everyone lined up, smiling, even Terezi, makes me think that tomorrow’s upd8 is where the violence will start. I am/was mostly sure that it would wait until act 7 and all of these upd8s would be chill, but&hellip;</p><p>Altho if tomorrow doesn’t have Jane also getting a big hug (lookit how happy she is! she looks ready to run to Dad as well!) and then a huge fucking group hug because all of these poor children need a parent so effing badly, I’ll be so bummed.</p>
