<blockquote>
<p>On the eve of their race&rsquo;s extinction, the twelve heroes would begin playing a game. They would make an admirable effort, but they would fail. Their civilization had not prepared them for the rigors of this game, and the ultimate reward would fall shy of their grasp. But their failure was more comprehensive, more systemic, than a result of simple inadequacy so common to young players of this game. Though they could not recognize it for the bad omen it was, this session was not the one in which they had been spawned. Such is the symptom of a subtle glitch affecting certain sessions, an error designed to trigger an unfathomable cascade of misfortune throughout paradox space. This glitch is the calling card of the one I serve. It is the discreet, gentlemanly manner in which he reserves his place in a universe for later visitation.</p>

<p>Holy shit. So, the trolls are actually on their second go as a species, and their session and/or universe was fucked to begin because it was set up for Lord English. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The young twenty-four would again be scattered in two groups, twelve modern contemporaries, and twelve ancients. But in addition to losing their memories of everything that had happened before the scratch, there was another catch for the failed heroes. In the new reality, they would not serve as the heroes. They would mature to become the ancestors of the twelve they formerly regarded as theirs, and this twelve would be chosen for glory. These children would be the heroes to achieve victory, and have the reward easily within reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aaaaaand in the previous session, our trolls were actually the ancestors, and the current ancestors were the players? Crazy!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course this promise was fulfilled to the letter, as you have seen. The entire bargain was executed without a single hitch, as those authorized by my master always are. There was however one minor anomaly. One of the failed heroes, in his new life as an ancient on this now brutal planet, began to remember. This is his story.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Signless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one of the players, who is now an ancestor, got memories back. About the game? </p>
