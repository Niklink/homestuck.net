<p>This equipment would soon be used to create Becquerel, a mutated combination of the genes from an ordinary dog in the early 20th century, and the DNA code in one of Rose&rsquo;s journals. AR? hides in the lab when he hears one of Jack&rsquo;s henchmen, the Draconian Dignitary. DD is carrying Rose&rsquo;s duplicated journals which he stole from Dave, and Dave&rsquo;s beta which was used as a bookmark.</p>
