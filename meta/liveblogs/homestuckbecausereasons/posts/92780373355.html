<h2>"FUUUUUUUUUCK. That’s not fair." Yes, the lucky break of Jade's death being Just seems quite unfair. But then again, look at it from a different perspective... if mind-controlled and corrupted God-Tiers acting (semi-?)against their wills couldn't be killed without reviving, wouldn't someone who could forcibly control God-Tier minions have an invulnerable, resurrecting army? From a Paradox Space perspective, it does seem cruel but fair?</h2>
