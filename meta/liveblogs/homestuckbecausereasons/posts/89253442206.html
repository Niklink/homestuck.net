<p>And Roxy Lalonde. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of her right now. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll grow on me eventually, but right now I find her ridiculously annoying.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the fact that she drinks so much, but maybe that&rsquo;s just me. After Rose made a crack about her mom getting drunk and passing out after a funeral, the whole always drinking thing just isn&rsquo;t funny to me. She&rsquo;s also a bit whiny for my taste.</p>
<p>Mostly I think I&rsquo;m being hard on the new kids because I&rsquo;m annoyed that the story has been interrupted. I don&rsquo;t want to get to know Roxy, I want to see what&rsquo;s going on with Rose! </p>
