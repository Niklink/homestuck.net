<p>Woah woah woah woah woah.</p>
<p>So, Roxy had an unprototyped ring delivered to her by CD, right? And I totally assumed it was the queen&rsquo;s ring from that session, the one that she gave to DD and then demanded back. But it sounds like she actually got this Ring of Void. And then she lost it when she was a Trickster, and John found it. Or maybe he found the other ring. Or maybe he found it, and then it will be stolen and given to Roxy. This is probably the part where temporal bullshit gets in the way. </p>
