<p>I want to see them meet so bad. Them and Dirk and Dave. But I am sure it will really hurt. Their relationships are so full of tension&hellip;except they don&rsquo;t really have relationships with each other, just with alternate universe versions of each other. It&rsquo;s kind of like when you become an adult, and you can never really deal with the issues you had with your parents when you were a child, because they&rsquo;re different people by the time you&rsquo;re grown up. Except they&rsquo;re really different people in this case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to see that pan out.</p>
