<h2>The Ultimate Riddle????</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure anything about this one.</p>
<p>We know the Ultimate Reward is creating a new universe, and I believe ruling over it in some capacity. It follows that the Ultimate Riddle would be related, but the URe is not the answer to the URi. I figure the URi has something to with the personal growth of the characters, the nature of free will when inevitability is brought into consideration, but&hellip;yeah I just really don&rsquo;t have any idea.  </p>
