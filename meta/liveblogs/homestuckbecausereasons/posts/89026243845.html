<p>So after the whole Green Sun thing, which is still blowing my mind, I went back to look at what Doc Scratch said, and I have some thoughts:</p>
<p>Like, his claims that he didn&rsquo;t lie are incredibly suspect. The Tumor <em>might</em> have enough power to destroy the Green Sun, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have, and couldn&rsquo;t have, making that statement just a hair shy of a lie. His earlier comments about destroying the Green Sun are even worse. Basically, he lays it out as &ldquo;attempt to destroy the sun -&gt; his death and Jack&rsquo;s neutralization.&rdquo; Now, &ldquo;attempt&rdquo; does mean that&ndash;</p>
<p>Actually I just figured it out. They <em>attempted </em>to destroy the sun, and that lead to Doc&rsquo;s death (I guess? it looked like meta!Hussie killed him), and it (more or less) lead to Jade reaching god-tier and fusing with the first guardian, which I figure means she can take out Jack, right? </p>
<p>However! He is a creepy bastard who seriously gaslight Vriska when she was what&hellip;10ish? Sure, she was &ldquo;going to&rdquo; do that shit anyway, but she&rsquo;s also had someone whispering in her ear that she should kill people, that she will kill people, that she&rsquo;s that type of person. No wonder she acted like she&rsquo;d been abused.</p>
<p>Also I just got that Terezi would call him Mr. Vanilla Milkshake because she would start seeing via scent.</p>
