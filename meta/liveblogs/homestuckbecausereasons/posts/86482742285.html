<p>New mystery! What is the Imminently Deceased?</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a time travel thing, that Sollux was hearing the voices of the trolls that died as a result of the game, the voices transported back through time. But then I went back and found that Karkat&rsquo;s coding handbook was for the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003902">Imminently Deceased</a> as well. I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s some sort of proto-god type thing, not like regular trolls but not the almighty, something powerful that dabbles in what the trolls are doing. </p>
