<p>Okay so once I found out that the epilogues were the length of a very long novel I started reading on my phone, so I don’t have pics for this, but man.</p><p>I was not expecting to think that Dave and Karkat deserve better than Jade? I was not expecting her to be the bad point in that relationship. </p><p>I mean she also deserves better than that relationship, she deserves partners who love her and are happy with her, and not ones who are with her because they’re too repressed or scared or whatever to break up with her. But wow is she ever selfish and willingly obtuse in this relationship!</p>
