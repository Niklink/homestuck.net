<p>I&hellip;feel kind of bad for him&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a kid. Who never had a parent, who had to share his body with someone he despised, and he&rsquo;s obviously really ashamed of not being that smart. Like&hellip;I kind of feel like nobody <em>really</em> taught him right from wrong, so even though he knows killing his sister is wrong, he doesn&rsquo;t understand why, or how serious it is. </p>
<p>I have a tendency to woobify characters, but I&rsquo;ve also got a real soft spot for kids who are on their own. Like, he never had much chance to be anything other than his most basic nature.</p>
