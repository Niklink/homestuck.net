<p>What.</p>
<p>The. </p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Dirk arrived at, IIRC, around the end of his infancy. Crawling, moving around on his own, but definitely not capable of caring for himself physically, much less emotionally or psychologically. So Cal must have been capable of feeding, changing, teaching, protecting, socializing, etc. a baby. </p>
<p>AND we have some heavy implications that Cal is evil and/or the tool of something evil. So we have Jake English, who is closely associated with Lord English, and now Dirk Strider, raised by Lil Cal the puppet that portends doom and destruction in every universe that contains him.</p>
<p>I am very concerned. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also viscerally upset by the idea of a child being raised without any opportunity for the love and care of a parent/general adult.</p>
