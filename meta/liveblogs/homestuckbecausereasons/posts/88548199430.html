<p>So this is from a bit ago, but I just figured out what Doc Scratch was talking about. The combination of Scratch talking about kissing, while the kids and trolls were kissing, confused the heck out of me. I thought it was related, and not about Jack kissing Snowman.</p>
<p>Doc&rsquo;s emotional reaction seems kind of weird to me. Like, he knew it was going to happen, he&rsquo;s probably known it was going to happen for forever, how does he get so mad about it? You&rsquo;d think omniscience would take the oomph out of most emotions.</p>
