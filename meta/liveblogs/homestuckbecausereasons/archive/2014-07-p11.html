<p>Alphacrimson and I decided that I am a Rogue of Light. Light because I love information, getting it and giving it to people. Heck, I want to be a teacher, even. I want to get all of the knowledge, and disseminate it to everyone possible. While being overworked and underpaid and probably getting yelled at by parents. I can&rsquo;t imagine what my planet would be, Halloworthless. I don&rsquo;t know how to come up with that. My strife specibus would totally be bookkind. As for my sprite! I originally thought I would toss in my laptop, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Preferably something useful to me, but harmless for prototyping the enemy.</p>
<p>I would totally end up dead like 15 minutes after booting up Sburb though. The timeline doesn&rsquo;t even fit, but I would manage it.</p>

<p>I checked with BKEW to make sure the basic facts for this were accurate-ish.</p>
<p>So, in our galaxy, there are a fuckton of planets that could potentially support life, and even more in the <em>universe. </em>So since Skaia has all the time in the world, it can wait for various planets to develop intelligent life capable of playing the game. Which means there&rsquo;s a chance that any given universe could spawn multiple successful sessions, which in turn would spawn multiple universes. Even if the number is as small as two, we&rsquo;d end up with exponential growth in the number of universes. </p>
<p>We heard from Aradia that she views Lord English as cleaning up loops. Could it also be that Lord English&rsquo;s murderous rampage be cleaning up an excess of universes? Especially if he&rsquo;s coming close to breaking through the void, and reaching whatever might be on the outside of that. And if whatever universe the kids are about to create will, as Calliope said, take them away from English and possibly the green sun, what does that mean about the structure of the multiverse?</p>
<p>Blah, I ran out of steam there. Oh well!</p>

<p>Prediction: The treasure Vriska found is going to attract Lord English. Well, okay, this idea is based on how together Lord English is, and he seems kiiiiind of like a mindless killing machine a lot of the time. But. He does seem to be able to show up in significant places, like Hussie&rsquo;s house, and he seems to have arranged it so ANOTHER Jack will arrive at LoFaF with his weapon/staff, so hunting down the ultimate weapon against him (maybe) is probably within his capabilities. Of course, the silly goose will then activate the weapon ability of it.</p>
<p>Which is&hellip;fuck, I don&rsquo;t even have a guess. We know that it exploits the in-universe physical laws. Probably has something to do with granting LE the immortality that cherubs have during mating, but probably a lot more than that. </p>
<p>Time to read some theories from other people, I guess.</p>

<h2>The Ultimate Riddle????</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure anything about this one.</p>
<p>We know the Ultimate Reward is creating a new universe, and I believe ruling over it in some capacity. It follows that the Ultimate Riddle would be related, but the URe is not the answer to the URi. I figure the URi has something to with the personal growth of the characters, the nature of free will when inevitability is brought into consideration, but&hellip;yeah I just really don&rsquo;t have any idea.  </p>

<h2>i just caught up on 80% of this blog in one go because i've been travelling/having exams since june and i am so full of homestuck nostalgia wow,, as for opinions, im not sure how far you've dwelled into the music albums but vriska's theme from Colours and Mayhem A has a morse code message in it and there's still fandom controversy over its meaning, any thoughts?</h2>
<p>Oh my gosh, you marathoned my liveblog? </p>
<p>Apparently it had SOS and/or some similar distress signal. I&rsquo;m not really very good with analyzing music or with morse code, but a lot of what Vriska does seems like a cry for help to me, so&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t find any good discussion or explanation on it, myself.</p>

<p>Sooooo, the trolls. I&rsquo;ll link to my original impressions, just because it was for fucking ever ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty bummed by the characters we lost in Horrorstuck. I get that they were the least useful for the plot, but I really liked <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86754447965/and-here-is-feferi-peixes-who-would-be-next-queen#notes">Feferi</a>, <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86480675065/nepeta-is-so-cute-i-do-not-know-what-to-do-with#notes">Nepeta</a>, and <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86564676860/time-to-meet-equius-zahhak-he-bosses-nepeta#notes">Equius</a>. I think we got a good ending for Equius, with him fusing with AR, and his whole speech to Nepeta about letting her get killed, but I&rsquo;m disappointed that Feferi and Nepeta never really got anything like that. I&rsquo;m hoping they&rsquo;ll show up again later but&hellip;I mean, maybe if BKEW is right and AR becomes Doc Scratch somehow, then Nepeta could show up and be useful for the plot, but that&rsquo;s about the only way I see it happening, and I don&rsquo;t like the AR/Scratch thing myself. </p>
<p>I forgot that I thought <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86644694640/aw-yeah-we-finally-meet-ga-for-real-aka-kanaya#notes">Kanaya</a> was like troll Jesus, since she was raised by a virgin mother (grub). Now I have a much better idea of what that means, but at the time it sounded Jesus-y, right? </p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86459027030/trolls-so-far-part-two">Tavros</a> and <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86483160010/the-vile-one-has-a-name-now-hiiiiiss-vriska-i#notes">Vriska</a> were my only really big opinion shifts. I said it elsewhere, but I basically started out loving Tavros and hating Vriska, and then came to love Vriska because she&rsquo;s not all bad. Tavros started to exasperate me because he&rsquo;s such a doormat.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86482149515/oh-i-really-like-aradia-too-shes-really-pretty#notes">Aradia</a> I don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion on either way. She was cool in the beginning, she&rsquo;s cool now, but I&rsquo;m not very interested in her. She&rsquo;s not one of the characters I want to read fanfic about just to see more of, at least. I wanted to know more about her internality when she was introduced, and now that I know more, she&rsquo;s still just really&hellip;detached. She&rsquo;s detached in an interesting way, what with her apparently loving the ghosties that are about to do but also being okay with them dying, but still.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86754432235/fucking-finally-i-have-met-all-the-trolls-so#notes">Eridan</a> just got more and more obnoxious as the story went on. He started out bad, and turned evil. The best part about him is he looks really cool, amirite?</p>
<p>I forgot how unhappy <a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86459027030/trolls-so-far-part-two">Sollux</a> was when he was first introduced. The poor thing really set off my maternal instincts. I&rsquo;m glad that he&rsquo;s much happier now that he&rsquo;s gone blind, half died, and then half resurrected kind of. Now he&rsquo;s off flying around with Feferi, his matesprite, and Nepeta, who is so adorable she must make everyone&rsquo;s life better with her mere presence. Good for him.</p>
<p><a href="http://homestuckbecausereasons.tumblr.com/post/86456718225/trolls-so-far-part-one">Karkat, Terezi, and Gamzee</a> all ended up on one post. For Karkat I went from finding him funny before Hivebent to exasperating as the main character of Hivebent, and now he&rsquo;s really one of my favorite characters. He&rsquo;s really angry, but he also really loves his friends. Terezi I found awesome then, and I still fucking love her. Enough said. Gamzee&hellip;</p>
<p>Gamzee had so much promise. I felt so bad that his lusus wasn&rsquo;t around to raise him. But I feel like I never get to see much of him directly. Other people will tell us what he&rsquo;s doing and why, but we don&rsquo;t get to see it the way we do with the other characters.  Almost everything we know about what he did in the three years they spent traveling was second hand from Karkat, Terezi, and a bit from Rose. We get some information about him from Caliborn, Karkat told us about what he did with the Black King, but mostly he&rsquo;s been slinking around in the shadows. It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me before how little he is actually present in the action, despite being constantly involved. It makes him a lot scarier, and a lot easier to underestimate. Hussie really is a masterful storyteller (and it&rsquo;s weird).</p>

<p>By the way I am still emotionally and psychologically scarred by Humanimals.</p>
<p>BKEW brought it up while explaining why Dirk might get together with Gamzee (nobody wanted Humanimals, nobody wants Dirk/Gamzee) and that made me want to not read the Gigaupdate when it comes around because eeeweaurghyuck I want to scrub Humanimals and anything vaguely associated from my memory.</p>
