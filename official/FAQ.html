    <h4>What is this?</h4>
    This is an archive of public blogging, question-answering, interviewing, etc. that Andrew Hussie has done with the MSPaint Adventures fanbase.
    If you don't know who that is, go read all the comics on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/</a>, then come back.
    <h4>Why'd you do this?</h4>
    I hope the things I've archived here will be interesting to his fans, both from the point of providing more insight
    into his works and being pretty funny on their own. Unfortunately, many of them were deleted from the original place they were
    posted. While backups existed (or else I wouldn't be able to make this archive), they were scattered and often in ugly
    plain text. The goal here is to have a central location, with most stuff looking more or less as it did when it first was
    written.
    <h4>Why don't you have &lt;insert thing&gt;?</h4>
    I don't have anything that ended before Problem Sleuth did; I think Andrew is trying to distance himself from that period, or at least
    distance his fans from it, and I'd feel bad lumping it together. MrCheeze <a href="http://mrcheeze.github.io/andrewhussie/">has a nice archive</a>
    if you do want even older stuff.

    Besides that, feel free to tell me if you think something should be added! See the next question for more details.
    <h4>A link/image is broken!</h4>
    Feel free to report it at <a href="https://github.com/wheals/wheals.github.io/issues">the issues page</a>, though make sure it hasn't been
    reported already. Additionally, if you can fix it (or another issue) yourself, just submit a pull request to the repository!
    <h4>Did you do this all yourself?</h4>
    Heck no. I couldn't have done it without:
    <ul>
        <li>MrCheeze, for humanimals/cheerfulbear/whistles/oldarts/netadventures (and generally for sending me down this path)</li>
        <li>Nokob (Dropbox user 40585720) for the formspring archive (including a copy of the layout!), Fuck Fancy Santas, and Kurt Logan</li>
        <li>Dropbox user 73817062 (possibly Nokob again?) for an archive of some of the Tumblr posts, especially for
            including the dates and images
        </li>
        <li>SM64Guy for the newsposts archive (including the very CSS you are looking at right now)</li>
        <li>archive.org for being incredibly awesome</li>
        <li>Makin for mural01.jpg and pointing me to the comics closet interview</li>
        <li>And Chamango for his video inspiring me to actually get off my ass and save something!</li>
    </ul>
