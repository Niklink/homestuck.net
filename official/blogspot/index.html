                                                would surely have it on authority from the celestial deities
                                                themselves
                                                which way would be optimal to set my soul aflame with rainbows and
                                                random forehead lasers, and how many shitty space dolphins would be
                                                ideal to stick up in my grill.<br><br>But there was a catch, and no,
                                                that catch amazingly wasn't simply the 150 bucks it apparently
                                                requires
                                                to drop a few reduced-opacity rainbow gradations, mediocre masking
                                                effects and augmented saturation adjustments on a photo that your
                                                unemployed neighbor took of you in the back yard. The real catch was
                                                that Erial seems to demand to speak with you on the phone before he
                                                Photochops your bad high school portrait with resources mined from a
                                                Google Image Search of the Hubble Deep Field. I guess maybe to get
                                                to
                                                know your soul?<br><br>Either way, I knew this phone call was going
                                                to
                                                be intense. I actually got kind of psyched for it, for a while. I
                                                practiced a modified form of enthusiasm, the kind that was basically
                                                genuine enough to trick his soul-sweeping lasers that scour my aura
                                                for
                                                traces of irony. I was prepared to throw out a lot of buzz phrases
                                                in a
                                                really excited way, like I was really eager to see how he would
                                                "blitz
                                                my chakras". I was going to say "blitz my chakras" a lot. I'm
                                                serious
                                                about that. It was going to be my go-to line. Like, dude, just go
                                                apeshit on those chakras. I'm not paypalling you a Benjie and a half
                                                for
                                                a bunch of weaksauce chakras. I want a chakra you can hang your hat
                                                on,
                                                WHILE you fry an egg on it, and makes you HIGH just in the amount of
                                                time it takes you to go Google whatever the fuck a chakra
                                                IS.<br><br>But then I chickened out and just did the damn soul

                                                conversation with some strange dude in a robe. Yeah that was a

                                                But let's get real here. I can Photoshop that guy under the table. I
                                                mean literally, I can literally make it appear as if he is squatting

                                                is it would have been a costly and tedious exercise in
                                                disappointment.

                                                the news section, since I'd honestly rather spend time making it
                                                than
                                                yapping about it all day. But hey I still realize that now and then

                                                couldn't
                                                get up the gumption to sit down and COMPOSE with a capital C, and

                                                are pretty long. I guess because I like to pretend what I do is
                                                complicated and nuanced.<br><br><span

                                                influence the present panel through a single atomic action. It
                                                shouldn't

                                                have in mind." A command can't try to do too much, but they often
                                                do.

                                                and the suggestors, whose main purpose is to leave their distinctive
                                                personal stamp on the story, and as a result, often resort to the
                                                outlandish, the overly elaborate, or the non sequitur. These are

                                                embrace in small doses, but they are poison to a cohesive story if
                                                resorted to regularly.<br><br>Consequently, actions of a more

                                                follows
                                                is that the user voice has been diminished. This is compounded with
                                                a
                                                great abundance of commands. A simple example. The hero approaches
                                                three
                                                doors. Which will you choose? Obviously all three doors will be
                                                suggested with a large enough pool of suggestors, plus plenty of
                                                clever
                                                non sequitur "option D" commands. Knowing this, which door the hero

                                                merely delayed the decision until the suggestions were made.<br><br>This
                                                principle is in play even with more complicated examples. A room
                                                full
                                                of objects. What will you do? For all intents, every possibility
                                                will be
                                                suggested. When the author knows he will have the field of ALL
                                                POSSIBILITY to choose from, it begins to mirror a more conventional
                                                writing process. That is what a writer does. He sits at his desk,
                                                combing through the field of all possibility in his mind, and
                                                arrives at
                                                the specific. This situation naturally leads to more pre-planning,
                                                and
                                                the greater appearance of marginalizing user input. But it is not a
                                                slight to the user. It is the nature of the creative process,
                                                rearing
                                                its head through this format.<br><br>Any remark like "This story is
                                                not
                                                user-driven enough," I believe is code for "This story is not
                                                haphazard
                                                enough." The wild and unusual commands are the ones that really make
                                                it
                                                feel like a gaggle of whimsical readers is in charge, imbuing the
                                                narrative with a sense of freedom, a feeling that the hero could do
                                                truly anything. The essence of freedom in this sense is the
                                                uncompromising subjugation of restraint. It is possible that this is
                                                also the exact opposite of what a good story requires! Regardless,
                                                the
                                                truth is almost all the commands are user suggestions, even the
                                                vanilla
                                                ones, which soften the voice of the user. Some are commands of a
                                                certain
                                                type I was looking for in advance, to push the action in a direction
                                                I
                                                had in mind. That is fairly unavoidable. To avoid it all the time
                                                would
                                                be unnatural, like a lobotomization of the creative process for the
                                                sake
                                                of maniacal adherence to a gimmick. But probably more often than
                                                not, I
                                                select commands on a whim, without any such narrative
                                                agendas.<br><br>I've
                                                kicked the tires on this format pretty aggressively. I've done the
                                                "pick the first command no matter what" thing, with its stream of
                                                consciousness results. I've kept the command selection more sedate
                                                and
                                                rational at times. And there are some stretches when I'm practically
                                                oblivious to the suggestion box, such as one or two week periods
                                                where
                                                my sole focus is on intensive animation chores, and the last thing
                                                on my
                                                mind is "How can I get the readers more involved at the helm of this
                                                story??" At times there gets to be a point where, with a story of
                                                this
                                                scope, the author can start to hear himself say, "Oh great guys,
                                                just
                                                what I need. More funny ideas!" The format, if nothing else, has a
                                                way
                                                of turning the author into a firehose of ideas, or at least it seems
                                                to
                                                for me. It sounds counter-intuitive, but eventually the best way to
                                                advance a story starts to be seeking strategies to curtail the
                                                endless
                                                stream of novelty, and slow the idea machine down a bit. I've done
                                                this
                                                at times by diminishing the influence of commands.<br><br>The

                                                example of this. More on that topic later.<br><br><span

                                                hard to quantify. It helps to understand what planning actually
                                                means in this context.<br><br>When
                                                you do something like this, it seems like the attitude of many
                                                readers
                                                is that the action should be almost entirely extemporaneous, or at
                                                least
                                                be sold to feel that way. Otherwise, why bother implementing user
                                                input
                                                at all? When evidence of planning becomes exposed, it carries the
                                                appearance of cheating in a way. Like an improv comic, who largely
                                                relies on the appearance of being off the cuff for his act to feel
                                                authentic. If the audience catches on that some of the material was
                                                prepared in advance, or that the go-to jokes are applicable
                                                regardless
                                                of what suggestion is shouted from the crowd, it loses

                                                long and short is, some very big picture stuff is planned in
                                                advance,
                                                and has been since page 1. In particular, various SYSTEMS were
                                                planned.
                                                Systems related to how the game works, how items are manufactured,
                                                how
                                                the environment is manipulated, aspects of the virtual universe they
                                                enter, and the ultimate purpose of the game. These are systems, but
                                                systems alone do not a plot make.<br><br>When it comes to plot
                                                elements,
                                                very little planning is done, and practically none at all before
                                                page
                                                1. A good example of the story taking an unanticipated turn is the
                                                post-apocalyptic elements, which I really had no idea I'd be getting
                                                into from the start. It felt like a necessary dynamic to add to the
                                                gaming system to help raise the stakes in the story. It was actually
                                                influenced by the various apocalyptic movie posters in John's room,
                                                and
                                                the discussions they had about them. Those were not planted in
                                                advance
                                                as foreshadowing, because there was nothing yet to foreshadow.
                                                Retroactive foreshadowing is a pretty common occurrence with
                                                projects
                                                like this. It often solidifies the illusion of planning. This was a
                                                case
                                                where some trivial nonsense I injected into the story turned out to
                                                be
                                                extremely relevant. Sometimes that happens with my own nonsense,
                                                sometimes it happens with reader-supplied nonsense.<br><br>But
                                                assuming
                                                there is some element of planning - and there is - the only issue
                                                remaining is how far in advance does story planning occur? That's
                                                why
                                                the subject of planning vs. extemporaneous story building is tricky.
                                                Plans don't exist... UNTIL SUDDENLY THEY DO! For example, there was
                                                a
                                                time when Jade (then known as "GG") made casual reference to having
                                                a
                                                pet, and a grandfather. These simple facts become a lock in the
                                                story,
                                                and it would be months until those details were elaborated upon. In
                                                the
                                                passing months, while I attend to other parts of the story, I have
                                                no
                                                choice but to dwell on those things she casually mentioned, and
                                                think
                                                about who they are, and how they fit into the bigger picture. This
                                                is
                                                certainly a form of planning, and the reader was witness to the
                                                plan's
                                                conception. And though technically, plot details which are sat on
                                                and
                                                incubated for months can no longer be considered extemporaneous, the
                                                ideas sure were extemporaneous when they were first
                                                mentioned!<br><br>This
                                                is exactly how most things end up being "planned". A concept is
                                                dropped
                                                on the reader, and then goes into hiding for a while. I think about
                                                it
                                                in the shadows. But even then, I deliberately keep the planned
                                                aspects a
                                                little vague and open-ended, so they can be modified to fit the
                                                details
                                                of the story when the time comes. This was especially evident when I
                                                started replaying certain Pesterchum conversations, from the other
                                                character's vantage in the past. At one point Dave was complaining
                                                about
                                                puppets. You could only picture what was going on at his end. In
                                                fact, I
                                                didn't even know, and I didn't really want to know. I let his
                                                narrative
                                                catch up to that point, then molded the events to match his side of
                                                the
                                                conversation. Again, the illusion of planning arises.<br><br>That's
                                                what I do with every concept introduced. I try to keep it a little
                                                generalized and flexible, something I can return to later with more
                                                refinement, and mix with user input. That was the driving paradigm
                                                behind all the game systems. Everywhere you look with the game
                                                systems,
                                                you see inherent flexibility. The ability to combine items with
                                                other
                                                items. The ability to prototype a Kernelsprite with anything, twice.
                                                The
                                                ability to manipulate a house in almost any way.<br><br>The
                                                philosophy
                                                here is two-fold. The obvious side of it is, it allows readers a
                                                more
                                                built-in means of influencing the world we create here. But the less
                                                obvious motivation, and maybe the more important one, is that it
                                                helps
                                                spark the imagination of the reader. The story, ultimately, can only
                                                go
                                                down the path it goes down. But before it does, the reader can
                                                understand these game mechanics, and speculate on all the
                                                possibilities.
                                                What sort of objects would you combine if you were playing the game?
                                                What would you prototype with? What kind of villains would that
                                                create?
                                                There are millions of different versions of the game that could be
                                                played, a unique instance for each player. This is all theoretically
                                                supposed to be part of the fun.<br><br><br><span

                                                at this point. At least more of the major story changing ideas come

                                                there, while the suggestion box plays the role of driving the

                                                of story discussion, it changed a lot about how I interface with

                                                input. Discussion and speculation about the story is much more

                                                and nuanced than user commands can be, which are generally along the

                                                entertaining the same notion, but hadn't yet committed to it, and

                                                this sort of thing, because I tend to establish a lot of patterns,

                                                pattern,
                                                or disregard it, almost arbitrarily. This keeps readers on their
                                                toes.
                                                But in this case, people guessed quite a number of things, including
                                                knights, mummies, and game trophies. I ran with those three, plus a

                                                hard to think of a lot of good examples of this though, possibly
                                                because all sources of inspiration have sort of blurred together. It
                                                gets hard to trace back to the origins of many of the
                                                ideas.<br><br><span

 did the Wayward Vagabond come into play? Was it something vague like 
"there's some dude in the future who accidentally stumbles his way into 
these events somehow", or was he almost entirely just made up as things

things about him playing part in a grander chess metaphor when you 
started working with Nanna's exposition? Did you always know that he 
ended up where Rose once was?</span><br><br>That's a lot of questions! I'll group it all under what I'll dub THE WV

                                                to
                                                experiment with the format. Though the reader didn't know it at the
                                                time, WV was issuing the commands instead of the readers. All the
                                                readers knew was there was a funny voice controlling John, and that

                                                resurface again at the end of Act 2.<br><br>The main purpose of the

                                                command experiment was to take a step back from that tension of the
                                                author-user dynamic for a while, and see how that went. The tension
                                                being primarily in the struggle to control the direction of the
                                                story.
                                                With a fictional character at the helm, you not only have a voice
                                                that
                                                can be more cooperative with advancing the plot (even though he
                                                didn't
                                                sound that cooperative), but also can be a more distinctive and
                                                unified
                                                voice of an actual character, with his own yet unknown agenda. It
                                                stayed
                                                that way for about a month I think. It was interesting for a while,
                                                but
                                                in the end I decided it wasn't the best way to drive the story in
                                                the
                                                long run, so I reverted to business as usual.<br><br>But the plan
                                                with
                                                WV, from the first command he issued, was that eventually he would
                                                become a playable character. I thought he would be playable (i.e.
                                                taking
                                                user commands) while the kids' actions remained buffered in that
                                                way.
                                                Of course it didn't quite pan out like that. They all became
                                                playable at
                                                once, each with his/her own suggestion box. But the difference with
                                                WV
                                                was that I made a concerted effort never to plan anything about his
                                                story arc. In fact, I've been pretty religious about keeping
                                                everything
                                                that happens in the post-apocalypse arcs as unplanned as possible. I
                                                don't think about it until I have to. So WV's story evolved very
                                                organically, entirely through cues from reader commands, much like
                                                the
                                                beginning of Problem Sleuth. But unlike Problem Sleuth, he existed
                                                in a
                                                world full of already well established story elements, so the
                                                whimsical
                                                material sort of collided with the more intricate storyline that had
                                                developed. So I could use his slapdash shenanigans to continue to
                                                expose
                                                layers of the mythology behind the greater story, like the chess
                                                metaphor and the kingdoms, all sort of indirectly through chalk
                                                drawings
                                                and cans of Tab and such. His arc was one of the more fun to execute
                                                for this reason.<br><br>His involvement was pretty spur of the
                                                moment, a
                                                way to drastically mix things up. There was no grand architecture to
                                                it
                                                at all, other than "he will issue commands, and then later, users
                                                will
                                                issue commands for him." But given that, I'm surprised by how his
                                                involvement made Act 2 feel like a fairly cohesive piece overall. It
                                                began with him finding the underground bunker in a wasteland. We
                                                knew
                                                nothing of him other than what a few cranky directives indicated
                                                about
                                                him. We watched him learn and develop, and later, in interacting
                                                with
                                                him directly, he supplied some reasons to like him and root for him.
                                                And
                                                finally at the end of the act, he blasts off in that bunker he found
                                                to
                                                open the act, and we see sequences that tie back to the end of Act
                                                1,
                                                such as the meteor collision with John's house, and the geological
                                                evolution of the crater that taunted anyone who tried to make a
                                                suggestion for a month.<br><br>Of course, these sequences raised
                                                more questions than they answered. After all, it was only Act 2.<br><br><span

                                                I thought it would run for a year, like PS did. From 04/13/09 to
                                                04/13/10.<br><br>But
                                                that seems unrealistic now. It has taken a lot longer to get the
                                                story
                                                revved up than I thought. This is largely due to experimenting with
                                                and
                                                taking the time to master different media, like Flash. But also due
                                                to
                                                the more general and universally applicable principal: EVERYTHING
                                                WILL
                                                TAKE LONGER THAN YOU THINK IT WILL, ALWAYS. I never planned to run

                                                for a year from the start. It just worked out that way. If I had, it
                                                probably would have taken two years.<br><br>What I'm thinking now
                                                is,
                                                04/13/10 will still be a key date. The story will build to something
                                                critical on that date. But then it will keep going for a while
                                                longer,
                                                to allow it to wrap up more naturally. Whether this is for another
                                                year,
                                                or less, I can't say. But I'd rather it not be more.<br><br><span

                                                is
                                                quite different from what it was even one year ago (though still
                                                stylistically similar). Exactly one year divides <a

                                                I was showed the latter example one year ago, and was told to
                                                produce
                                                stuff like that in any sustainable way, I probably would have said
                                                that
                                                sounded kinda crazy! But that was before this self-imposed gauntlet
                                                of
                                                working with Flash and figuring out more efficient animation
                                                strategies.<br><br>But
                                                watching the site evolve to support that type of content has me
                                                thinking it will just keep evolving. The broadest purpose of the
                                                site is
                                                to serve as a sort of accelerator for my abilities as a creator. At
                                                least in retrospect, that is the purpose it's served. By the time
                                                I'm
                                                ready to move on to a new adventure, the footing may have shifted so
                                                much, it may not even be an "adventure" as we know it. Regardless,
                                                I'm
                                                sure there'll be something to follow, and I'll keep producing
                                                content.<br><br>Unless I decide to be a douche and just up and quit.

                                                some point during the last few months of working on PS. The
                                                inspiration
                                                centered around a simple scene I had in my head, and not much else.
                                                I
                                                pictured a kid playing a game in his room, while another player
                                                manipulated his room the way you edit an environment in The Sims. I
                                                pictured the kid being able to manipulate the other kid's
                                                environment
                                                too, but it wasn't long before I latched on to the potential
                                                conflict
                                                present in one kid strictly being at the mercy of the other. Over
                                                time I
                                                came up with other game mechanics to complement this, and add some
                                                degree of purpose. In this time I also developed this image of a
                                                story
                                                template that combined an RPG like Earthbound with games like The
                                                Sims
                                                and Spore. Even now that still seems like a pretty good way to
                                                describe
                                                Homestuck, though the story didn't unfold the way I pictured at all.<br><br><a

                                                also designed all four characters</a>
                                                shortly before I started HS. I didn't know much about these
                                                characters
                                                at the time, other than some really vague personality profiles.

                                                named them as they were introduced.<br><br><span

                                                but they did always have their Pesterchum handles before they were
                                                named.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Was 'Homestuck' the only title you had in mind for Homestuck, or were there other titles you considered but decided not to use?</span><br><br>The
                                                only other candidate I considered was "Sburb", which was a sort of
                                                deliberately ugly word reminiscent of the name of a Sim game. You
                                                could
                                                either liken it to Sim-burb, or to Spore, another crude 5-letter
                                                word
                                                beginning with S. But for that reason, that it's kind of crude and
                                                really awkward to say, I thought it was best left as just the name
                                                of
                                                the game in the game.<br><br>Besides, Homestuck better follows the
                                                templates of the previous adventure titles, like

                                                don't know if I still have the sketch. Probably not. Basically,
                                                picture the kids as they are now, but with squarer heads. <a

                                                method. I gave up, restarted on 4/13, with less frequent

                                                of Flash. Through the arbitrarily designated significance of the
                                                starting date, it went from a story about 4 10 year olds to one
                                                about 4

                                                There's a tradition in cartooning of ignoring the age of a child
                                                when
                                                considering his/her demeanor and degree of sophistication. See:

                                                and Hobbes. Cartoon kids will act according to their age when it
                                                feels
                                                relevant. Other times, they won't.<br><br>Maybe the biggest

                                                in the hop in age is the very slightly added plausibility to
                                                speculation
                                                on any romantic angle between them. This is very important for fans

                                                with the facts. First, because ideas that conflict with the facts
                                                never
                                                actually occur to me. Second, because ideas are a dime a dozen. I
                                                have
                                                too many as it is.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">I know you don't plan out much beyond the most barest of bones, but at what point do you take something and really roll it out?</span><br><br>"Roll
                                                it out" could mean a lot of things. The biggest variable here I
                                                think
                                                is how far in advance. Once a certain concept is committed to, it
                                                becomes inevitable to follow through with it via some sort of plan,
                                                but
                                                it's rarely that far in advance.<br><br>Like with the WV sequence,
                                                he
                                                draws a chess board, and eventually it becomes clear to me he is
                                                going
                                                to play a simulated game of chess. So I think "Ok, he's already got
                                                16
                                                cans over there which can serve as the major pieces like knights and
                                                rooks and such. I'm going to need another 16 pawns, so I'll stick 16
                                                cans of Tab in the other vault." That's a plan committed to in
                                                advance
                                                by days, or a week, or whatever it was.<br><br>But then knowing
                                                that,
                                                it's a little deceptive what was planned that way, and what wasn't.
                                                You
                                                might think I stuck the oil and chalk in the room to manufacture
                                                those
                                                outcomes, the chess game and the wall drawings. Not true at all. The
                                                oil, chalk, amber and uranium were stuck in the room strictly as
                                                parallels to the four types of known grist. The fact that he used
                                                them
                                                in those ways was a convenient bonus, and could possibly be viewed
                                                as a
                                                happy coincidence. Honestly when I drew the firefly in the amber, it
                                                never occurred to me that it would be released and become a cute
                                                ally.<br><br>You
                                                could look at these stories, HS and PS mostly, as huge strings of
                                                these
                                                happy coincidences. When I recognize the potential for those kinds
                                                of
                                                connectivity, I try to make as much hay out of them as possible.<br><br><span
                                                    style="font-weight: bold;">The
 kernelsprites seem like a great potential way to let input radically 
impact the course of the story. Do you have all of the prototypings 
planned ahead already, or do you intend to leave at least some of them 
up to reader influence?</span><br><br>There have been significant
                                                allusions in the story that certain prototyping outcomes are
                                                inevitable.
                                                Will this pan out? We'll see. Nothing is set in stone.<br><br>But
                                                this was always an area where I'd intended readers to have
                                                significant influence, and I'm sure it still will be.<br><br><span
                                                    style="font-weight: bold;">Were the Guardians already planned (with designs?) along with the kids, or were they designed later?</span><br><br>All
                                                the guardians were drawn a day or two before they first
                                                appeared.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">And for the really big things (lets say the flash), what's the averageish storyboarding time for it?</span><br><br>Never
                                                more than 10 minutes. Spending too much time on storyboarding feels
                                                like wasting time I could be spending on the "real" work.<br><br>Time
                                                spent on actual execution of a Flash animation on average is a day
                                                (or a
                                                night, more typically). The one requiring the most time was the end
                                                of
                                                Act 2 animation (obviously, I'm sure), which took something like 3
                                                or 4
                                                days. It's hard to say for sure, because I was making the WV
                                                countdown
                                                animation that preceded simultaneously.<br><br>A cruel irony for me
                                                personally is that the longest hiatuses the site has to endure are
                                                periods of time over which I am working the hardest.<br><br>OH WELL.<br><br><span
                                                    style="font-weight: bold;">How much better at Flash would you say you are now than when you started?</span><br><br>Good
                                                enough to use it. More than can be said when I started. Speed is the
                                                primary dividend of experience for me. It may seem like I'm getting
                                                better with the quality of the animation at the same time. But if
                                                this
                                                is the case I think this mostly results from increased speed. When I
                                                learn how to save time, I always tend to apply those time-savings to
                                                producing things that are increasingly elaborate. The latter half of
                                                Problem Sleuth documented this phenomenon with animated
                                                GIFs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you plan to use the same kind of sound effects shown in the first strife page of John for future flash updates?</span><br><br>I

                                                add,
                                                and I'm a bit neutral on how they enhance the experience. Later on I
                                                might completely change my mind though. Who knows.<br><br><span

                                                Rose's shirt was once a depiction of a character from a fake cute
                                                cartoon show which I totally made up called "Squiddles!". She then
                                                went
                                                about defacing this shirt to make it look mean! The shirt itself
                                                actually appears to be defaced, with ink missing around the eyes and
                                                mouth area (but it's a pretty subtle effect, because the ink color
                                                is
                                                very close to the shirt color).<br><br>The cool thing about <a

                                                is you can get either the faux-Lovecraftian defaced version, or the
                                                undefaced version (so you can deface it yourself!) Just make sure
                                                you
                                                select the option you want underneath: "LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!" if
                                                you
                                                want the defaced version, or "DON'T LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!" if you
                                                want
                                                it unmolested!<br><br>So there you have it. The story of the shirts,
                                                and some sweet merch all rolled into one.

                                                I'll explain my thinking on first using Flash, then switching back
                                                so

                                                happened first.<br><br>On April 10th, I launched the new story, <a
                                                    href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=5">"Homestuck",
                                                made entirely in Flash</a>. My plan was to complete the whole story
                                                in Flash, adding interactivity, music, and stuff like that. I
                                                completed 8 pages.<br><br>This
                                                turned out to be way too much work. To put this in perspective,
                                                doing

                                                joking about that! <br><br>I
                                                don't know if this says more about my inexperience with Flash, or my
                                                proficiency with Photoshop (in which all PS work was done). Probably
                                                both. I don't mind dealing with Actionscript, really. It was the
                                                whole
                                                environment I had trouble with. It felt very unnatural to draw in,
                                                and
                                                difficult to manage everything spread across multiple time lines and
                                                movie clips. Even doing simple things was like pulling
                                                teeth.<br><br>So in order to prevent the story from grinding to a
                                                halt down the road, I just switched back to Photoshop and <a
                                                    href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6">started
                                                over</a>.
                                                I kept the Flash version online, and recast it as the "Homestuck
                                                BETA",
                                                which now appears to have been "released" three days prior to the
                                                current version. You could even call this a happy coincidence that
                                                appears to have been planned, since it echoes an aspect of the
                                                story, in
                                                which the beta for a game was released three days prior to his
                                                birthday.<br><br>But I guess MSPA tends to be full of these sorts of
                                                coincidences which make you wonder what was planned and what wasn't.
                                                But
                                                here I am telling you it wasn't planned! I should really work on
                                                being
                                                more mysterious.<br><br>(You will also note, the age of the
                                                character
                                                jumped from 10 to 13 in this three day span. This is, for mysterious
                                                reasons, because the "magic number" for this story is now 4/13
                                                rather
                                                than 4/10.)<br><br>Perhaps ironically, the Homestuck beta, which was
                                                never supposed to be a beta, genuinely did serve as a beta! I had a
                                                chance to test out some things there, and when I realized it wasn't
                                                working, I pulled the plug. But I got to establish the Flash page
                                                infrastructure on the site, so now I can use Flash pages whenever I
                                                want.<br><br>And I intend to! Sparingly. Mostly for when I want to
                                                include musical elements, which was really my biggest reason for
                                                switching to Flash in the first place.<br><br>The bottom line is,
                                                the
                                                adjustment I made now feels right. Overall, I like the look better.
                                                And
                                                the production is virtually effortless, a process streamlined over
                                                hundreds of pages of Problem Sleuth. This will allow me to update
                                                with
                                                crazy amounts of pages as usual, which I think you will agree is a
                                                very
                                                important thing. Maybe the most important thing!

                                                So I guess it's time to get serious about this.<br><br>The first
                                                matter
                                                of business is related to music and sound. As I've hinted at before,
                                                I'm
                                                going to take a stab at a Flash production this time. This means
                                                I'll
                                                be incorporating music and sound effects on some of the
                                                pages.<br><br>Here's the catch: I am not actually a musician and
                                                have no particular talent for the craft! <span
                                                    style="font-weight:bold;">My
 plan is to have the music be reader-created, through a collaborative 
process. If you are proficient in the field of music or sound, and would
 like to participate in this process, <strike>please email me!</strike>***</span> I will send you the information you
                                                need to do this!<br><br>***
                                                The response to this was great! Thanks to everyone who contacted me.
                                                I'm sure that's enough participants for now, but if this changes,
                                                I'll
                                                let you all know.<br><br>(A note on sound for the next adventure:
                                                music/sound will never at any point be critical to following the
                                                story!
                                                So it's still fine if you check it out at work without the volume or
                                                such.)<br><br>That's the main thing I wanted to mention. If all goes
                                                according to plan, there will be a new story on the front page
                                                tomorrow.<br><br>-------------------<br><br>A side note:<br><br>Many
                                                have wondered if PS will be printed in a book at some point.<br><br>I
                                                can't say when for sure, but there WILL be a Problem Sleuth book.
                                                Probably released in multiple volumes on account of acute hugeness.

                                                I thought about doing something funny on my site for April Fools, but
                                                then I didn't because I don't really have time for that nonsense!
                                                Instead I thought I'd regurgitate this article from my old blog I posted
                                                on 4/1 last year about how big corporations like to play these really
                                                limp-wristed April Fools gags on us now. <br><br>But then I reread it
                                                and thought it was kind of long and boring. It sort of spun out of
                                                control at the end into a rant about how stupid "funny commercials" are.
                                                I thought I'd post that snippet alone, because man, I really hate funny
                                                commercials!<br><br>Originally posted: 04-01-08<br>-----------------------------<br><br>I
                                                fucking HATE funny commercials. I deeply resent the arena of humor being
                                                hijacked in this way. It makes me sort of hate the universe of humor
                                                itself, somehow. I almost find it distasteful to participate in the same
                                                discipline in which thrives such a loud and broad display of clumsy,
                                                floundering suck. I guess this phenomenon has its roots in the
                                                coronation of the Superbowl as the great custodian of funny commercials.
                                                These commercials are popularly alleged to be as much of a draw to the
                                                high ratings event as the game itself, and I guess this just got
                                                corporations thinking; why not make every day the Superbowl? And they
                                                did. Now every day is like a fresh, highly competitive Superbowl of
                                                unfunny bullshit.<br><br>I could go on about "funny" commercials and why
                                                I hate them forever, but who has the energy for that? (Especially after
                                                we've all eaten ourselves into a wheelchair from the customary April
                                                Fools feast.) Occasionally there are some genuinely funny commercials. I
                                                just don't care. All the unfunny "funny" ones ruin the funny "funny"
                                                ones completely. I'm tired of waiting for the shoe to drop in the
                                                30-second bullshit vignette on Glade scented candles. I'm tired of
                                                "funny" moments being punctuated by awkward pauses of silence (while we
                                                all laugh, I guess. And then meditate on Werther's Originals.) I'm tired
                                                of people getting hit in the groin with a can of Green Giant corn, or
                                                backed over by a Hertz rental car, and hearing them shout "I'm ok!" in
                                                the fading moments. I don't want to laugh, and the attempt to inflict
                                                this reaction on me is causing me pain. There's a good chance I am
                                                watching the show I'm watching for this very purpose, to be made to
                                                laugh. The creators of this show are ostensibly good at causing this
                                                reaction. <span style="font-style:italic;">You aren't</span>, Holiday
                                                Inn.<br><br>It's not that I want commercials to be funnier, up to the
                                                standards of the few that are funny. It's that I want them all to stop
                                                being funny. Do you remember a time when not every commercial was trying
                                                to be a damned Farrelly brothers movie? I do. They just said, "look, we
                                                sort of have this product..." and played some catchy music. They were
                                                benign. Ignorable. Corporations have forgotten their role in the social
                                                order. I don't want them to be cool, or to be my friend, or to make me
                                                laugh. Corporations should be stodgy, blunt, and humorless, and if it's
                                                not to much to fucking ask, mildly nefarious.<br><br>Now we can look
                                                forward to them latching on to pranks. Oh boy! And as with "funny"
                                                commercials, they will seize them as competitive advantages (re: adhere
                                                to them unwaiveringly as competitive upkeep). Thus will begin the kind
                                                of obnoxious one-upsmanship we see with funny commercials, with
                                                companies trying to be ever edgier, ever more surprising in their
                                                April's gotchas. Coke isn't going to take it lying down when Pepsi
                                                reveals in April, 2012 that 30% of all Pepsi cans the previous year
                                                contained moderate to major amounts of fetal tissue floating in the
                                                liquid [PSYCHE]. Let us begin a great arms race. Not one of munitions
                                                and warhead stockpiles, but of whoopee cushions and chattering

                                                to colonize Mars. Hehehehehe! Nice one guys!<br><br>Edit: I just went
                                                there immediately after I typed that expecting to find some fun stuff,
                                                and sure enough, I knew it was a gag before I even <a

                                                Wait, there are more people I wanted to talk about!<br><br>KC Green
                                                draws outstanding comics. His myriad of websites are all among my
                                                favorites ever. Please <a href="http://kcgreendotcom.com/">go
                                                to his site</a> and visit his odd collection of satellite-websites like
                                                horribleville and gunshow and please read all of the comics there at
                                                once. <br><br>I bumped into him on the street the first night of the
                                                weekend when everyone was roving around the town under varying
                                                magnitudes of inebriation and chilliness. I recognized him and proceeded
                                                to orbit about his radiant, molten core of affability, but I did not
                                                introduce myself. Later in the evening I mumbled my name, and he
                                                recognized it, and offered a hug to celebrate the recognition. It was
                                                not because he was inebriated; the beverage in his hand was a root beer
                                                you see. Neither was it on account of chilliness. He's just a hella nice
                                                guy! <br><br>I also met Zach Weiner, which was another high point. He
                                                does <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/">SMBC</a>,
                                                which is a comic that has the uncanny ability to be EXTREMELY FUNNY on
                                                EVERY SINGLE OCCASION IT UPDATES, which is JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. Zach
                                                was also all hells of cool and drew me a picture of a llama with a brain
                                                in a jar for a head. I'll keep it folded in my breast pocket for the
                                                rest of my life, until one day it takes a bullet for me. The very bullet
                                                which passes clean through it and into my heart, rendering me not alive
                                                anymore.<br><br>There was also a gentleman named John Keogh who does a
                                                comic called <a href="http://www.lucid-tv.com/">Lucid
                                                TV</a>, which I had not read before. I just checked it out and it is
                                                quite funny! You should check it out too.<br><br>This encounter was
                                                precipitated because he said hello and told me he liked my work. Not
                                                MSPA in this case, but a comic I used to do a while ago called
                                                Humanimals. I'm always impressed when someone has heard of Humanimals
                                                before, and I am downright flabbergasted when people tell me they
                                                actually like it. <a href="images/blurb85.gif">Here's
                                                a sample</a> if you care to trespass into... <br><br>I'll shut my
                                                flowery trap this once. It is a comic about nude men with hooves and
                                                udders and stuff. They work in an office and they are always happy.

                                                I went to a weekend gathering for webcomic authors and enjoyers alike,
                                                and good times were had! You could say it was authoritatively
                                                enjoyed.<br><br>Speaking of authoritativity, the event was spearheaded
                                                and organized by <a href="http://www.octopuspie.com/">Meredith
                                                Gran</a>, who does a really great comic about a young octopus who lives
                                                in New York City, trying to make it out there. Ok, that is not what the
                                                comic is about. But you should go read it and see what it is

                                                a guy who likes candy corn or something, and possibly wore a hat at one

                                                burns, I saved those for my foes.) Everybody who approached me was

                                                is basically nothing at all. I mean I draw stuff sometimes, but

                                                Perhaps this man is a poor caricature of Ray Romano? I am going to guess

                                                tuned in on the last.<br><br>The beginning was humble in ways that go
                                                beyond a simple reader count. Humble might not even be the right word.
                                                The word's blade might need to be dulled further -- from something used
                                                to slice butter, to something used to ladle paste into the mouth of an
                                                infant.<br><br>I was wondering what sort of story to make, so I drew a
                                                detective on a blank canvas. Then I thought he should be in a room, of
                                                course. Probably a detective's office, because that's where detectives
                                                usually are. He needed a phone and a gun. Clearly those two items would
                                                alone suffice, I thought. The wall over there looked a little blank so I
                                                drew a safe. A window for ambience. A door for exit, which may or may
                                                not have been locked; I wasn't sure yet.<br><br>What I was also
                                                oblivious to was the two other detectives who would show up later, and
                                                to their adjacent offices. I was oblivious to the world of imagination,
                                                and the desk-made fort that would be its gateway. I didn't know the
                                                window lead there either, and I didn't know you could only get to that
                                                place I didn't know about if it was plugged in. I didn't know about the
                                                candy in his pocket, the dames in their dollhouse, the kingpin in his
                                                ship, or the weasel in his palace.<br><br>Those I's would be dotted by
                                                your suggestions, and the T's would be crossed by my reaction to them.
                                                It was a storytelling game of cat and mouse, and you presumably just
                                                finished reading the aftermath of our year-long, Tom and Jerry-style
                                                rampage through the house.<br><br>And if at the beginning you told me I
                                                would have a group of characters fight a single giant monster every day
                                                for almost six months, I would have told you... well, I would have told
                                                you that sounds awesome! But then I probably wouldn't have done it.
                                                Because I would have known I was going to do it. And what fun would that
                                                have been?<br><br>It's hard to believe it's done, I'm sure mostly for me
                                                personally. If you do the math, you'll note I produced an average of
                                                more than 5 images per day, every single day for that year-long stretch.
                                                In retrospect, it was a matter of routine inseparable from day to day
                                                existence. I didn't notice the effort, and I didn't notice the year. It
                                                wasn't a labor. It was just what I did.<br><br>But I guess it's more
                                                than just a shift in habitual momentum. There's a note of melancholy.
                                                These detectives won't be up to their antics anymore (unless I make
                                                deliberate exceptions to their retirement, of course). It seems strange
                                                to me that these characters have become so well defined in my mind, even
                                                though they've never uttered a single word. It was never supposed to be
                                                that way. It was just supposed to be about a cruddy-looking dude in his
                                                office.<br><br>But that said, I'm pretty excited to get working on
                                                something new. And maybe, if you're not all that busy, we could take the
                                                first step of this amazing new journey together.<br><br>Thanks for
                                                reading!<br><br>- Andrew.

                                                my and Jeff's work, aside from breadth of ambition.
                                                (Amphibition?)<br><br>They both dwelt on swampy planets. Though mine was
                                                supposed to be Earth, since my story followed a Superman template. I
                                                figured he might as well since he shared a prefix with that hero. Jeff's
                                                looks like it fits into more of a Star Wars mold, which would make
                                                "Amphibia" somewhat akin to Yoda's swampy planet I guess.<br><br>Also
                                                note that while Jeff's planet was plagued by a "terrorist group called
                                                MEGA", my story was published by MEGA comics. This is obviously a word
                                                one dare not leave uncapitalized. Also both these frogs had really cool
                                                underground lairs.<br><br>But I'm afraid that's where the similarities

                                                is today, let alone the grisly marks which I pawned off as letters at
                                                age 11. You'll also note Jeff could actually string together a pretty
                                                decent sentence. "<a

                                                Amphibia was not without its evil forces…</a>" Note the fairly
                                                sophisticated use of the double negative to take a little something off
                                                the sentence for rhetorical purposes. He could have taken the easy route
                                                and said "Amphibia had so many evil forces!" Or, "Amphibia had all hella
                                                evil forces up ins, yo!" if he wanted to produce a tone of jocular
                                                irony. (Although I doubt that sort of irony had been invented yet in
                                                1986.) The point is, he wasn't using language as a blunt instrument to
                                                say what he wanted to say.<br><br>Whereas I took that blunt instrument,
                                                used it to murder a family of four, and hid the bodies in my garage. <a

                                                11 year-old did this. To me it doesn't look very far beyond the reach of
                                                a 6 year-old. Where does one even begin dissecting this?<br><br>Ok, the

                                                to go down to the "science plant". Where they do science. He wants him
                                                to steal some science. Fair enough. Then he instructs him to take a
                                                "disgise", and we shortly receive a humorous payoff. His disguise is
                                                simply a jacket. Ha ha, right?<br><br>Maybe. Except that I explicitly
                                                remember that I did not intend for this to be a joke. I was serious.
                                                That was his serious disguise.<br><br>Then at gunpoint, or maybe tube of
                                                Ben-Gaypoint, he commands the aardvark fellow to surrender the main
                                                project. Like, the main science thing they do. He wants him to hand over
                                                the big science thing. But it turns out he "already launched it". He
                                                launched all the science they were working on into space, and he is
                                                sorry about it. Maybe if the snake with the dick hat got there a little
                                                earlier, all that science would still be there.<br><br>Then later on in

                                                actually even liked comics. All I really wanted to do was design the
                                                next Super Mario Bros. game and mail it to some Japanese developers. I
                                                actually tried to do this several times, and I just assumed whoever
                                                looked at it would be blown away by my ideas while making little hushed
                                                noises of polite awe in that distinctly Japanese way.<br><br>When I was
                                                11 my teachers thought I was retarded. This isn't some sort of joke to
                                                make you laugh. This is actually true. For a while thereafter I resented
                                                the accusation. But looking back on this work I'm starting to think they
                                                might have been technically right. Whatever the case, I don't know why I
                                                ever had the notion that I was artistically inclined before age
                                                11.<br><br>But in looking through this archive of relics, it's pretty
                                                clear my artistic development took a major leap in the following year.

                                                heavily by Rob Liefeld's work in the early 90s. Still, looking back on

                                                    time to honor their memory with the somber gravity that can only be

                                                Ok so here's what up.<br><br>I was recently embroiled (am still

                                                It was fun (is still fun???) but then due to some mental handicap

                                                was getting a little long in the tooth. VERTICALLY SPEAKING.<br><br>It
                                                was like a great venerable redwood and I was sort of like an especially
                                                angry Paul Bunyan, or just some really terrifically huge dude with an

                                                of HEIGHT ITSELF.<br><br>So I did this and dusted my hands but then some

                                                it all back up somehow, even though that stuff I deleted is gone

                                                said, and in the process probably charting new frontiers in the realm of
                                                dubious fidelity.<br><br>Anyway why don't we take this thing from the

They're great, you guys! I recommend watching them in order because it is comedy gold that builds on itself really nicely. <span
                                                    style="font-weight: bold;">Andrew Hussie is quickly becoming the only person whose house I park outside at night. I just want to watch him eat his dinner.</span></span><br><br>And
                                                I was tickled he said it, but then I went on to say (probably) something
                                                like this.<br><br>Ryan, you're not fooling anyone sitting in your car,
                                                sort of ducking down behind your dashboard like that. [I think I
                                                probably mentioned something about opera glasses, or goggles here, which
                                                he retrieved from his glovebox. I'm not sure why I would suggest he keep
                                                such a thing in his glovebox. I think my motivation was probably to use
                                                language to cast him as a bit of a lithe-fingered fop. I'm going to go
                                                ahead and assume that I was successful in this respect, and blow my

                                                mentioned something about how I was eating a turkey sandwich or
                                                something. Oops, I should probably return to my "voice".]<br><br>Ryan, I
                                                am eating a turkey sandwich or something.<br><br>Ok, Ryan caught wind of
                                                all that PRETTY QUICK.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">February 5th, 2009: UPDATE: Last night Andrew had a open-faced turkey sandwich with a glass of water. He took a bite and chewed, frowning at his dinner. He sprinkled some pepper on top, and took another bite. The sandwich appeared to satisfy him now, and he dispatched it quickly, drinking the water all in one go at the end. Impressive. He then reached for his empty glass, turning it upside down and using it like a microphone. I couldn't hear clearly, but it sounded like he was reciting "Baby Got Back", sitting there at the dinner table. I felt like he was putting on a show for my benefit. I got suspicious - did he know he was being watched? But then some water slide down the glass onto his lap and he jumped up, brushing his slacks down and running out of the room, cursing. It was that little detail that made the whole evening worthwhile.</span><br><br>I
                                                said something kind of complicated in response to this… wait, oops, hang
                                                on…<br><br>Ryan. I'm going to say something kind of complicated in
                                                response to this. The basic gist of it will be that while you are
                                                distracted by my outrageous domestic broadcast and its embarrassing void
                                                of self-awareness, I took the opportunity to deploy a servant through my
                                                cellar door and into the yard and had him shove a whole can of cookie
                                                dough into your car's tailpipe.<br><br>CHECK AND MATE, prank
                                                buddy.<br><br>Alright I didn't say that last part, but in just
                                                transcribing it now, oh man. It was just so sweet how I did that to his
                                                car.<br><br>Ryan didn't really see it that way though.<br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">February 6th, 2009: Okay, so I guess Andrew has, like, a butler? Who he pays to stuff food into my car's exhaust pipe? And that's fine, that's cool. We all need jobs. But when I drive home and my car stalls out a few minutes in and it's because the tail pipe is blocked with chocolate-chip cookie dough, it's not that awesome. Andrew's house is at the end of a deserted lane surrounded by a bunch of fields, and now I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere.</span><br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">So I walk back to Andrew's place - takes about 20 minutes. I ring the doorbell. No answer. I knock on the door. All the lights are on; I know he's home. I go round back and I stand in the dark of his back yard and I can see him there in his living room. His soggy slacks are spread out on the couch. His underpants are tasteful. He's rapping again. It sounds like - yes, it's Rapper's Delight. Andrew's really belting it: "Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat / And the food just aint no good? / I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed / and the chicken tastes like wood."</span><br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">I've never realized how much of that song is about food.</span><br><br>At

                                                caused to wonder by Ryan's tone if he is treating my submission to Urban

                                                "rhetorical wind-down", a sort of genteel "that's all, folks" in the
                                                manner so comfortable and form-fitting to men of North's class and

                                                pretty awesome at this. I helped him make these by writing these sort of
                                                "scripts", suggesting how to arrange clips, what lines to dub, and what
                                                sort of visual effects to try out. I also usually supply the, uh, <a

                                                as long as it stays fun. We'll keep doing Star Trek for a while, but
                                                will likely also try using samples from other TV shows and movies later.

Oakland Raiders linebacker Bill Romanowski fending off a wild, flaming black steed, in a mystical snowcapped mountain setting. I don’t know if it’s the concept alone, which itself is obviously mind-blowing. Maybe it’s also the curious, vaguely-humanoid musculature of the horse. It has a man’s bicep and triceps, and some very suspiciously man-like back muscles. Or maybe it’s the flaming mane, which on closer inspection, doesn’t resemble flame so much as synthetic orange puppet hair. This steed is either from hell, or has recently escaped Fraggle Rock, and is ready to tear the entire NFL a new asshole. But he didn’t count on bumping into Bill Romo (understandably, since he was bucking around the middle of the damned Himalayas).</span><br><br>I
                                                wrote that several years ago, and before I catch myself extolling the
                                                grandeur of the painterly genius of “T” again, I’ll just get to the
                                                point. A couple years ago around the same time of year, a little before
                                                Christmas, I wrote “T” an email offering to purchase the painting. In
                                                addition to gushing about his work with strategically vapid and
                                                obsequious prose, I offered him $50 for it. This offer was more than
                                                fair, I thought. He however declined, saying he simply could not accept
                                                any less than $400 for it.<br><br>Ok, so obviously I thought this guy
                                                was out of his fucking mind, turning down good money of any quantity for
                                                this ugly piece of shit. But that was probably just the anger of
                                                rejection talking. I would get over it.<br><br>Recently, I offered to
                                                buy the painting again, hoping he might have forgotten about his
                                                hard-line stance and come to terms with the unsellability of his putrid
                                                work (oops, there I go again with the bitterness. I have good reason
                                                again though.) I was prepared to offer another $50, maybe go a little
                                                higher if necessary. It’s turning into a kind of Christmas tradition.
                                                This is how all of the finest holiday traditions begin, I think. Through
                                                hostile adherence to something pointless and mildly
                                                excruciating.<br><br>This is how the latest interaction went down.
                                                Here’s the pitch I opened with:<br><br><span

                                                    style="font-style: italic;">Thank you for your time.</span><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">———–</span><br><br>Personally I think it
                                                was a pretty well composed pitch. The tone is right, and I think I
                                                tailored my demeanor to seem just convincingly stupid enough to
                                                genuinely like this retarded painting (which I do!). Notice how I
                                                downplayed his vicious prior obstinacy by referring to the paintings as
                                                “unavailable if I recall”. Master stroke. Also I didn’t come out firing
                                                with a dollar figure, mainly because I didn’t want to scare him off
                                                right away. I needed to ease him into the fact that I am still only
                                                willing to part with $50 for this abomination.<br><br>Anyway, this was
                                                his reply.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">———–</span><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">Hey Andrew,</span><br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">Thanks for checking back. I do have a price on the painting it is $425. A few people have e-mailed me about buying it for less, but I would rather just hang on to it. I like the piece a lot and haven’t painted anything since it. It was to be the first in a series of sports fantasy paintings, but I have gotten side tracked with my job and other family things so I haven’t started painting again. I will get back to it soon. So, if you want it for the $425 it is yours, if not, I will keep it on my wall.</span><br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">Thank you</span><br><span

                                                to describe my reaction. Nay, a single word.<br><br>LIVIDITY.<br><br>$425??
                                                So it seems he actually <span style="font-style: italic;">raised </span>the
                                                price over the years. Oh, and PARDON my skepticism at the implication
                                                that he has received other offers over the years for his idiotic shit.
                                                He is probably only vaguely recollecting the ONE time it happened. From
                                                ME.<br><br>Naturally, I swallowed my indignation like the bitch I am. I
                                                just need that painting, and obviously it’s going to take more fancy
                                                footwork to pry it from his grubby, miserly hands. I responded, and this
                                                was my first sentence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow, it is very cool that it is still for sale! I would</span><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">really love to have it.</span><br><br>Notice
                                                how easily I slip back into character. Whatever obscure pocket of
                                                personal acumen this is, I seem to possess it in spades. I probably
                                                could have been one of those spies who entrenches himself in Russian
                                                territory, uncovering intelligence on nuclear sites. Except instead of
                                                nukes, I would be disarming the Russian aristocracy of all their shitty
                                                paintings of horses, and vanishing with them into the
                                                night.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">$425 is a lot of money for me. But I think your work</span><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">is good and you deserve to be compensated well for it.</span><br><br>If
                                                his heart wasn’t made of stone, it would melt at this line. I am playing
                                                up to his megalomaniacal belief that his work actually has value,
                                                combined with voicing a sad state of affairs for myself, like I am a
                                                charity case. For all he knows, I’m like Tiny Tim with a crutch, holding
                                                up my tin bowl, and instead of asking for gruel, saying, “Could I please
                                                ‘ave a paintin’ sir, preferably an NFL-star-battling-horse themed one,
                                                sir?” These sentiments would tickle any artist starved for positive
                                                feedback for his ghastly work, assuming he wasn’t totally deranged.
                                                Unfortunately, his heart is made of stone, and he is deranged.<br><br>I
                                                went on in that reply, trying to strike up a deal, but he didn’t
                                                respond. I was prepared to dish out more toadying remarks, too, like
                                                seriously encouraging him to take up painting again, and saying I would
                                                love to see him continue his series of sports fantasy paintings. This
                                                has the added bonus of being true. How about Terrel Owens putting a
                                                unicorn in a headlock while forging through an enchanted jungle? Or star
                                                kicker Adam Vinatieri kicking an ogre in the groin near a dark wizard’s
                                                castle? Or quarterback Tom Brady kissing a male elf atop a bubbling
                                                volcano? This series would be fucking dynamite, and I’d love to own the
                                                whole set (as long as I didn’t have to sell my kidneys for it).<br><br>Anyway,
                                                if I want this painting, obviously the only thing I can do is pay the
                                                full price for it. And I think you will agree, it would be ridiculous
                                                for me to spend that much of my own money on it.<br><br>That’s where YOU
                                                come in!<br><br>So <span style="font-style: italic;">pony </span>up with
                                                the donations guys, and soon you will enjoy the vicarious delights of
                                                owning a completely unique work of art, through me!<br><br>If you
                                                donate, I will do something for you. I’m not really sure what yet. It
                                                depends on the size of the donation. If it’s only like $5 or $10, I
                                                might just write you a detailed thank you note. Maybe I will email you a
                                                custom sketch or a comic too, we’ll see. If you make a bigger donation,
                                                like $50, you can feel free to be more demanding with my time, like tell
                                                me to draw you a comic and mail it to you. I don’t know, but I’ll make
                                                it worth your while. Come on guys, let’s work on this together!<br><br>Of
                                                course the biggest reward is the giving itself, and knowing you are
                                                contributing to a cause much more worthwhile than something lame like
                                                upgrading my computer. YAWN!<br><br>The donation thermometer is ready to

                                                delirious convulsions become more pronounced. Feverish visions pester
                                                me, like an overzealous carnival employee lurking, poised to frighten in
                                                a shoddy haunted house. My breathing is heavy. “No… horse…” I say. “I
                                                can’t… linebacker…” I wheeze. At once I sit upright, and shout, “I will

                                                gridiron!!!”<br><br>There was a voice. A rich, amber-throated sort of
                                                vocal honey.<br><br><span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">“Yes you will.”</span><br><br>My eyes
                                                find a pair of shoes. Cream-colored, polished like the ivory bust of an
                                                African prince, presented as a gift to European royalty. Draped over
                                                them, cuffs belonging to pants, also cream-colored and well pressed. I
                                                look up. And up. This man had no end! His elegant form broadened as it
                                                ascended, and was stopped, nay, <span style="font-style: italic;">commanded to halt</span>
                                                by a pair of shoulders so sturdy, a banquet for a devout Catholic family
                                                of fifteen could be served on each, and the settings would not jostle an
                                                inch while a pious, <span style="font-style: italic;">severe </span>grace
                                                was conducted by the patriarch. Hanging on these shoulders was a coat of
                                                immaculate cut, and a slightly different cream color. Other colors of
                                                cream accented his tie, shirt, and kerchief, and above all those was a
                                                bronze, manly face. His smile was wide and serene, his eyes winter blue,
                                                deep with kindness. He wore a cream-colored hat.<br><br>The room hushed.
                                                Somewhere a utensil fell onto a piece of glass or ceramic. Everyone
                                                knew.<br><br>It was Paul Elsewho.<br><br>“But… but sir. I can’t buy it.
                                                I haven’t the monetary discretion for the painting.” It was the
                                                sniveling blither indigenous to the tongue of the truly
                                                pathetic.<br><br>“You do now,” the man said, clicking a ball point pen,
                                                which now busied itself above a checkbook. “You can and you will buy
                                                that painting of a steed grappling with an Oakland-area
                                                athlete.”<br><br>The words resonated from his amber throat. I knew any
                                                words from it would be true. He handed me the check for $155 United
                                                States dollars.<br><br>Even though I know in my heart the assurance of
                                                this man stretches further than that of the U.S. Treasury for the merit
                                                of the currency he gives me, my craven mouth cannot help but persist in
                                                its loathsome habits of doubt. “But sir… what if it’s <span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">still </span>not enough?”<br><br>That’s
                                                when the door exploded off its hinges, as if punched inward by the
                                                searing daylight. The light was then blocked by another imposing form,
                                                its silhouette boasting the contours of an exquisite physique. “<span
                                                    style="font-style: italic;">That’s where I come in,</span>” boomed
                                                the rugged, gravelly voice.<br><br>I clutched the garb of Paul E. and
                                                hid behind his confident frame. I quivered like a reprehensible bit of
                                                cowardly gelatin. Through the tears, I saw who it was. Everyone did. It
                                                was the legendary Paul W.<br><br>He tossed his scarf over one shoulder.
                                                The tables in the room lifted an inch off the ground with each
                                                astonishing footstep. The bartender hid. Paul dropped a sack full of
                                                valuables, which made a noise like a gypsy’s cart smashing into a brick
                                                wall. Printed on the bag was “$155”. As I opened the bag, a gleam of
                                                golden yellow illuminated my wonder-stricken face.<br><br>The mighty
                                                Paul W. caressed his stubble thoughtfully while giving me a stern look.
                                                The corner of his mouth turned upward, ever so slightly, and he winked.
                                                “Yeah, that oughta do you just fine,” he said. A man in a bowler cap
                                                sitting in a dingy corner must have rubbed him the wrong way at that
                                                moment. Paul W. turned to the man and, with a ferocity in his eyes
                                                typically recalled only by dead lion tamers, said, “What the fuck are
                                                you looking at?” The man’s head exploded.<br><br>Yes, the other Paul was
                                                right. It <span style="font-style: italic;">did </span>oughta do me. It
                                                did oughta do me <span style="font-style: italic;">just fine</span>.
                                                These two noble, charitable, magnificent men entered my life and changed
                                                everything. They asked for nothing in return. Indeed, what does one give
                                                the man who has everything, and everything to give? These two radiant
                                                titans of masculine virtue, they are perfect. They are gracious
                                                perfection itself. I feel emboldened as I am flanked by my two Pauls, my
                                                saviors of brawn, my dapper hulks of sapient mettle. I can do anything
                                                with my Pauls. My arms interlock with theirs, and together we spin
                                                pinwheels into the night. Spinning, spinning, laughing, and
                                                spinning.<br><br>I speak to you as a man who has had his faith in
                                                humanity not merely restored, not merely gutted, refitted with high-end
                                                parts and refurbished, but as a man who has had humanity itself, in the

                                                all. It is a spirited, flaming-maned buck against the petulant voice
                                                which tells us our dreams can’t come true, and we are just wasting our
                                                time.<br><br>Dreams do come true. Your wildest wishes can happen. Magic
                                                is real. Fairytales are sobering nonfiction, and your bravest fancies
                                                are a rock-fucking-solid lock. Hold fast to your dreams and soon you
                                                will hold them over your head like the beating, dripping heart of the
                                                enemy commander.<br><br>When one commits his entire being to an idea or
                                                an outcome, never relenting or wavering, he cannot be stopped. It is not
                                                a matter of stating firmly, “One day, I will have that painting.” It is
                                                a matter of stating, and believing, “That painting is already mine. The
                                                momentary separation between myself and the painting is incidental to
                                                the reality, and of no consequence.” When one compresses all his drive
                                                and concentration onto the head of a pin for one goal, it can no longer
                                                be considered a goal. It is a conclusion manifest in the furling
                                                parchments of reality itself.<br><br>So I urge you to celebrate this
                                                victory with me. The road was long and rocky, the potholes numerous. But

                                                <span style="font-size:78%;">(Since Christmas is in the air, I thought it would be a good time for a redux of this article posted in my old blog. It is probably the only thing worth salvaging from that blog and in this season of sharing I feel it is important to share it with you.</span>)<br><br>I
                                                hate Fancy-Santas. Unlike the archetypical Santa, the cliché with the
                                                bright red suit, white beard, and unassuming accessories like black
                                                boots and mittens, the Fancy-Santa tries to be more than the cliché. He
                                                drapes himself in ruffled velvets, expensive European leathers, peculiar
                                                hats, and often can be found carrying around armloads of weird things,
                                                like a wreath, or a swan, or a fucking bush.<br><br>But what’s worse is
                                                his attitude. The Fancy-Santa acts like he’s too good to be a normal
                                                Santa. While a normal Santa is jolly and friendly, the Fancy-Santa is
                                                aloof and acts like a complete prick. He likes to think he’s mysterious,
                                                tiptoeing through the woods, occasionally pausing to cast an abstract
                                                gaze into the northern sky. What mortal could dare to even fathom the
                                                grand majesties behind his ice-blue eyes and gaudy attire? What mortal
                                                could afford one of his bullshit dolls or figurines?<br><br>You’ve
                                                probably seen a Fancy-Santa slowly rotating on a QVC broadcast for about
                                                $900, while a spokeswoman gingerly strokes his velvet robes. She uses
                                                words like “beautiful” and “exquisite” and “precious”. To her, the
                                                Fancy-Santa resembles everything good and decent left in her life, a
                                                life looted of joy by a succession of boorish ex-husbands. There is
                                                nothing boorish about a Fancy-Santa though. He is thoughtful, dignified,
                                                elegant—the perfect gentleman. And the perfect catch for a lonely
                                                middle-aged woman, if she could just find him in the fucking woods
                                                first. (protip: set a bear trap)<br><br>Still don’t know what I’m
                                                talking about? You’re lucky, then. But I’m afraid your good fortune runs
                                                out here.<br><br>This is a Fancy-Santa.<br><br><img

                                                look at that asshole. Who the fuck does he think he is? What is he so
                                                happy about?<br><br>Listen, you imposter. You are not Kris Kringle. Put
                                                down the wreath, take off your silly robes, and go home.<br><br>They are
                                                always decked out in an absurd plethora of ridiculous shit. He’s got a
                                                small crystal tree. You know, in case of an emergency. And some kind of
                                                weird lacey doily hanging from it. Also, a list for authenticity’s sake,
                                                because—ha ha!—he’s got to confirm which children are naughty or nice.
                                                As if he’s going to be giving children jack shit.<br><br>If you ever run
                                                into a Fancy-Santa like this, the only proper recourse is to splash your
                                                eggnog in his face and pull down his pants.<br><br>Next. Get a load of
                                                this horse’s ass.<br><br><img
                                                    src="images/fancysanta2.jpg"><br><br>There’s
                                                always a vague implication that Fancy-Santas are a kind of rugged
                                                proprietor of the wilderness. A great mystical outdoorsman, oozing
                                                communion with nature. He is a noble champion of the woods and all its
                                                critters.<br><br>Bullshit!<br><br>He’s a glorified bum. Just because he
                                                lives in the woods doesn’t mean he owns them. And just because animals
                                                are stupid enough to sidle up to him doesn’t mean he won’t eat them and
                                                then use their pelts to craft another luxurious hooded robe. I imagine
                                                happening upon a Fancy-Santa skulking around in the woods is sort of
                                                like seeing Bigfoot. Except Bigfoot probably has the decency to at least
                                                dig a hole before he takes a shit on the ground.<br><br>This next one is
                                                a better example than the previous two, and I hate him all the more,
                                                because he takes himself more seriously.<br><br><img
                                                    src="images/fancysanta3.jpg"><br><br>It’s
                                                hard work being such a monumental bullshit artist like a Fancy-Santa. It
                                                helps to look grave and stern, as if you are burdened by crushing
                                                mountains of hidden wisdom. Secretly, the only wisdom he guards is an
                                                array of handy pointers on how to get fleas out of a beard.<br><br>I
                                                guess the unspoken hook to a Fancy-Santa is that they’re supposed to be
                                                magic. Like a fucking wizard. They really look like wizards, but with a
                                                Santa twist. I think the Fancy-Santa thing is really just a way for
                                                wizard freaks to get their jollies (yes, that was a Santa pun). But they
                                                can do so through the safety of mainstream Christmas orthodoxy.
                                                Similarly, the same middle-aged women who like wizards possibly like
                                                them because they remind them of Santa, the great paternal emblem, and
                                                perhaps hence, the “perfect man”. This perhaps further is the disturbing
                                                central pivot point for some weird fetish or visceral attraction
                                                programmed into the female mind set to erupt in middle age. The
                                                wizard/Santa allure is deep-rooted stuff, and expresses itself in many
                                                ways. I wonder if it explains in part the popularity of Harry Potter.
                                                Dumbledore was sort of like a Fancy-Santa. I wonder if J.K. Rowling
                                                collects Fancy-Santas. Of course, Dumbledore was proven to be gay, which
                                                on further reflection may be a critical part of the mythos. It makes
                                                these ideal mystical men unavailable, furthering the complex of
                                                unattainability. Come to think of it, now I’m sure all Fancy-Santas must
                                                be gay too. They are FANCY, after all. The rouge cheeks, the playful
                                                smirks. It’s all adding up. They’re a bunch of nomadic fags whisking
                                                through the snow.<br><br>But in reality, they aren’t even really all
                                                that magic. Because they’re stupid frauds. I mean, what can they really
                                                do that’s all that great? Maybe give you a sly wink, and when you turn
                                                around again, he’s gone. BIG FUCKING DEAL! He’s a self-absorbed jackass
                                                who would never use whatever lame powers he has to help anyone. He’s
                                                certainly not delivering presents. The real Santa doesn’t mess around.
                                                He’s got a whole army of slave labor devoted to making toys, and
                                                actually has the means to deliver them. A Fancy-Santa barely bothers
                                                with the pretense. He might get around to giving kids presents if all
                                                the children on the earth happened to live in the fucking woods with
                                                him, maybe in a two mile radius. But they don’t, they live in houses
                                                like normal people. Whenever a Fancy-Santa carries around toys, it is
                                                just for show. If you see him walking around with a teddy bear, I can
                                                guarantee you that in the near future, rather than give it to a
                                                youngster, he will burn it for warmth.<br><br>Then there are ones like
                                                this, which are doubly infuriating. This dude thinks he’s Gandalf the
                                                White. Jesus Christ, he’s so fucking pure, I bet every time he bends
                                                over, a flock of white doves flaps frantically out of his
                                                ass.<br><br><img
                                                    src="images/fancysanta4.jpg"><br><br>It’s
                                                passed off like he’s the Lord of Winter or some bullshit. If you ever
                                                see an idiot like this traipsing around, the proper thing to do is
                                                approach him from behind and push him into a pile of snow and then run
                                                away.<br><br>This one is riding a fucking bear. Go to hell,
                                                numbnuts!<br><br><img

                                                at the absurd hat on this one. And what exactly does he think he’s going
                                                to do with that sled full of toys? Who’s he trying to kid? Even he has
                                                to feel too much shame in his reprehensible appearance to parade that
                                                sled around in public. Anyway, I doubt he could push that thing more
                                                than a mile through the woods before suffering from cardiac

                                                as if standard Fancy-Santa fare weren’t dreadful enough, there are these
                                                themed ones. This one is sort of hobo-themed. This wayward wintry

                                                terrifying. I can’t tell whether he embodies the spirit of Christmas, or
                                                the malice of a dark Asian emperor. I’ve never seen a Santa, or any

                                                to say on the subject, and when I uncover more of these vile and
