                                <p><em>If you haven't read through MS Paint Adventures already then go
                                    do so. This article will still be here. MS Paint Adventures is something
                                    of a comic experiment in comics and animation using elements of
                                    old-school text based adventure games. Every move of the characters
                                    through the imaginative and complicated worlds is dictated by reader
                                    suggestions (although many events take on an unexpected turn when they
                                    play out). Problem Sleuth is the longest-running story so far and Andrew
                                    wrapped the series up pretty much one year from its beginning. The
                                    adventure is massive, with so many characters and convoluted puzzles
                                    they had to put a wiki together just to keep track of it all. I thought
                                    that it would be a good time to catch up with Andrew as he was putting
                                    the finishing touches on the site's current project and planning his
                                    next
                                    move.</em><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br><strong>CC:</strong>
                                    How does it feel to be finished with Problem Sleuth?<br><br><strong>Andrew
                                        Hussie:</strong> As of this moment, I'm working on epilogue pages, and still
                                    have some "extras" to get to as well.<br><br>But
                                    even if I were totally finished, and exhaling upon the completion of
                                    this unusual magnum opus, I'm pretty sure it would feel weird. I would
                                    just start on something else right away rather than let whatever that
                                    feeling was sink in.<br><br>I guess I don't really consider rest or
                                    vacations as things which apply to creativity. Always working on
                                    projects is sort of my year-round vacation from the awkward feeling of
                                    not producing anything. Even now I've been working on plans for the next
                                    story, before I've totally wrapped up PS.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> For the
                                    uninitiated, how did MS Paint Adventures get started?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    It started on an internet forum. It worked very much the same way as it
                                    does now, but replies to the thread served as suggestions. The entire <a
                                            href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=1">Jail
                                        Break</a> story was made in a forum.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong>
                                    While I know the adventure was written with fan input how much of the
                                    “weird puzzle shit” did you work out in advance of commands? It seems to
                                    fit pretty well.<br><br><strong>AH:</strong> Pretty much every puzzle
                                    was worked out in advance. I guess some of the following could be
                                    "spoilers" for anyone who hasn't finished reading [Problem Sleuth].
                                    Albeit a very silly kind of spoiler.<br><br>For instance, the moment I
                                    drew the Snoop bust, I knew it was going to be the thing to deal the
                                    final hit to the boss. Also I put the giant fan on the island knowing it
                                    would be the thing to finally blow the bust off whatever it was sitting
                                    on (which turned out to be a pair of mecha legs). And then I knew
                                    they'd have to go on a sort of puzzle adventure through the brothel to
                                    plug in the fan, which I only bothered to design once the plug had
                                    landed in there. I let the pace of the story dictate how complicated the
                                    puzzle was. Since it looked like I needed to buy them some time to beat
                                    DMK, I made it fairly complicated with all the peepshow windows and
                                    food trucks and such. And then later I bought even more time by
                                    stretching the cord across the universe. The delay tactics got pretty
                                    flagrant and ridiculous actually.<br><br>But even though I did the planning, I
                                    always let the reader supply the actions to get us there.<br><br>The
                                    earlier puzzle to dislodge the oboe was the same way. It even involved
                                    the same elements: supplying power to a fan to blow a large bust across a
                                    room so it could fall through the floor on a piano. And even earlier
                                    than that a fan was used to blow a heavy safe door shut. Various puzzle
                                    themes have been established throughout, and were adhered to somewhat.
                                    It was sort of obvious when you think about it, that the big fan would
                                    be used to blow a heavy bust to kill the boss at the end (as insane as
                                    that sentence just sounded). Yet I don't think many people saw it
                                    coming. This is possibly because I established patterns of
                                    unpredictability in other ways.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> Were there any PC
                                    adventure games in particular you would say influenced MSPA? Did you play a lot of
                                    them?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    The only ones I can recall playing all the way through were Maniac
                                    Mansion and Day of the Tentacle. But I wouldn't say any specific
                                    adventure game influenced it - only the conceptual framework, and a lot
                                    of the quirks and foibles common to those games.<br><br>Other types of
                                    games had their influence too, like fighting games and RPGs, especially
                                    when it came to certain gags, as well as visual styles in the animated
                                    frames.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> How crazy did the suggestions get?
                                    Were there any you were tempted to indulge that would have derailed the
                                    project or made things more difficult?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    Almost all of them were pretty crazy, and almost all of them did derail
                                    the project, in a way. The entire plot is really an elaborate series of
                                    derailings. That's mostly why it went on for so long. Crazy suggestions
                                    lend themselves to tangents. The whole story is composed of these
                                    tangents, which I did my best to weave together cohesively. But how it
                                    did sprawl.<br><br>But there were plenty that were "crazy" in the sense
                                    that I would read it, and then reread it, and say "Wow, I have no idea
                                    what this guy is talking about." Especially toward the end when the
                                    universe was becoming particularly unhinged. I think some readers were
                                    taking cues from those outlandish events, and then tried to advance the
                                    story on those terms, usually concocting fanciful ways to increase the
                                    speed of light, and often writing paragraphs in the process. Even though
                                    there was no way I would, or could possibly, use an entire paragraph as
                                    a command.<br><br>But I think in those cases they were using the
                                    suggestion box as a sort of whiteboard to just think out loud about some
                                    wild stuff, which was cool and all part of the fun. The suggestion box
                                    often made for some enjoyable reads. And many times even though I didn't
                                    explicitly use someone's suggestion, I would take what they were
                                    getting at and work it into the story in a less direct way. If there are
                                    readers who think I never used their suggestions, there is a decent
                                    chance I just might have without them realizing it!<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> What
                                    has the response from the community been on seeing Problem Sleuth
                                    finish?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    It has been an incredible response, far beyond my expectations. I've
                                    always managed to respond to just about ever letter I get from a reader,
                                    but when the story ended, not only could I not respond to everything, I
                                    had trouble keeping up with just reading it all. I'm quite grateful to
                                    everyone who's stuck with me through this story, and to those who voiced
                                    appreciation for it in whatever way.<br><br>The sense I've come away
                                    with is that people actually like it when things have a proper ending.
                                    It's not uncommon for things on the internet to end, but it seems more
                                    usually to be characterized by a petering out, which is less well
                                    received. Tying up the loose ends makes all the difference. It's a model
                                    of storytelling I will strive to repeat.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> Do you plan on

                                    I'm going to put a very brief cap on both unfinished stories, just so
                                    neither one is left hanging. I won't spend much time on that though.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong>
                                    Then what?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong> There will be a story following PS very shortly. It will be very
                                    different.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> Some people might not know about the <a
                                            href="https://mrcheeze.github.io/andrewhussie/">comics </a>you
                                    drew before MSPA began. What prompted you to put out your own webcomic?
                                    Is a more traditional, semi-daily strip something you might return to
                                    again?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong> I started a webcomic because it was
                                    what I was doing anyway: making comics. So like many others, I put them
                                    online. I doubt I'll get into it again though. I still like comics, but
                                    after doing MSPA for a while, I think it would seem awfully static and
                                    rigid. It's a medium I've already personally explored quite a bit, with a
                                    good variety of styles and approaches. I'd rather keep feeling out new
                                    boundaries, as long as it's possible.<br><br>This is even true with the
                                    next adventure. If you're thinking it's going to look like Problem
                                    Sleuth 2, but with new characters and a different genre setting, you'll
                                    be in for a surprise.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> You had a book released through
                                    Slave Labor Graphics, right?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong> Yes, it was called <a
                                            href="https://mrcheeze.github.io/andrewhussie/comic.html?comic=whistles">Whistles</a>.
                                    It was supposed to be the first of two books, and I have yet to finish
                                    the second. A fully rendered graphic novel is of course vastly more
                                    time-consuming than something like MSPA, page for page. But maybe that's
                                    one of the things I like about this format. The efficiency in conveying
                                    a complete story - the bang for the buck metric, I guess - seems to be
                                    very high.<br><br>I'll still finish it though, per what I was saying before about
                                    finishing stories.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> Something else you’re involved with
                                    that has been burning up the ‘net has been your<span
                                            style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> video editing project. How did
                                    that come about?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    My internet friend, Jan, who I've known for quite some time, wrote to
                                    me about a project he was thinking of, involving re-editing episodes of
                                    Star Trek TNG. I of course thought this was a fantastic idea, and we
                                    made about a dozen short episodes very quickly. He is a brilliant
                                    editor, and they wouldn't work even remotely as well if not for his
                                    technical expertise. My role was to write "scripts" and come up with
                                    funny ideas, but of course he comes up with a lot of great ideas too.<br><br>It's
                                    a very fun exercise, and I probably laugh at them as much as any fan of
                                    the "gazzora" youtube channel, since they're fresh to my eyes after
                                    he's finished crafting them over in Belgium. I had a feeling they would
                                    be the sort of thing to make the viral rounds across the internet. I
                                    thought there was a chance they'd take off when I got around to showing
                                    them to the MSPA audience, but as it turned out, they took off before I
                                    even had the chance.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> You’ve talked about
                                    expanding beyond Star Trek with these and we’ve already seen some Back
                                    to the Future. Any clues as to what we can look forward to
                                    next?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong>
                                    The plan was to do even more Back to the Future, possibly giving it as
                                    much attention as we gave Star Trek. But we've been pretty whimsical
                                    about it, working on whatever we happen to feel like at the moment.
                                    We've also talked about doing some shows like Fresh Prince and ALF. I
                                    feel like we could probably make just about anything work. Such is the
                                    power of editing.<br><br>But it's tough moving off of Star Trek, just because
                                    there's so much material there. We haven't really tapped even 1% of
                                    it.<br><br><strong>CC:</strong> Well, I appreciate your time. Before you go, though,
                                    I have to ask…am <em><strong>I</strong></em> a winner?<br><br><strong>AH:</strong> I
                                    don't know. Have you managed to escape your office yet?<br><br><br><br><em>Shit, I
