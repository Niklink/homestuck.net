  					<p><span style="color: #7889ce;">You enter the CULTURE HACKER 
SHRINE. The floor is littered with the SKULLS of old media. An ARTICLE 
with a CLEVER LEAD is here. What will you do?</span></p>
<p>Comics and games have always had a symbiotic relationship. There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://www.telltalegames.com/bone">games</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/">about</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_vs._Capcom_(series)">comics</a>, and more than a few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/browse.php?genre=3">comics about games</a>.
 Chasing the Wish even brought comics into the ARG scene a few years 
ago. These two media tend to collide often, thanks to a common nerdiness
 that permeates all things clever and visually appealing.</p>
<p>But I’ve yet to see a better fusion of sequential art and gaming than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/">Problem Sleuth</a>,
 an interactive one-panel comic that reads like a game, with all the 
trappings of an old school graphic adventure. This week, I picked the 
brain of Problem Sleuth creator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090124040639/http://www.andrewhussie.com/">Andrew Hussie</a> about how he builds a story out of reader suggestions, wit, and candy corn.</p>
<p><span style="color: #33cccc;"><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>Culture Hacker:</strong></span> </span>So, how does the interaction in Problem Sleuth work?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>Andrew Hussie:</strong></span> 
It is a mock adventure game driven by suggestions from readers, supplied
 in the form of&nbsp; commands”, the type which one might submit in a 
blinking text prompt in such a game. My blinking text prompt however 
doesn’t work. This is the first indication the reader/player is given 
that he or she is being hornswoggled by this website. The hornswoggling 
process only deepens and intensifies over the course of the Problem 
Sleuth epic.</p>
<p>Actually, the commands are submitted (of late) through a simple <a href="https://andrewhussie.blogspot.com/2008/12/ms-paint-adventures-suggestion-box.html">blog comments field</a>.
 I then groom the submissions carefully and select one based on a rather
 exacting set of standards, such as whichever one seems to capture the 
most striking intersection between cleverness and idiocy. Or, whichever 
the hell one I feel like picking. Then I draw the result of this 
command, and the story continues.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong></span> You’ve done “traditional” (non-interactive) comics before - on paper, even! How did you come to add an interactive element?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH:</strong></span> The premise
 of the question gives me too much credit. It implies I reached some 
crest in my artistic endeavors with my paper-based artwork and saw a 
vast new frontier of untapped expression before me. And then with a 
flourish of alchemical wizardry I declared WHAT THIS NEEDS… (I pause to 
produce a powdery substance from a vial)… is but a pinch of 
INTERACTIVITY!</p>
<p>Ok maybe it didn’t imply that at all. But let the record show that what I described above did not actually occur.</p>
<p>It was a game I started in an internet forum to pass the time. It was
 not art, or an exploration in interactive media, or for that matter, 
anything meant to be viewed by learned and civil men outside lurid 
parlor walls boxing in debauchery<br>
and the fumes of smoldering opiates.</p>
<p>But it gradually became those things, at least in my view. And as 
art, in an odd way, I’ve probably come to take it more seriously than 
any undertaking I’ve ever scribbled on a sheet of paper.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong></span> Do you think of your audience as readers, or as players?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH: </strong></span>I’ve never 
really thought about it. I don’t spend much time at all dwelling on it 
as either a game or a comic. I’d&nbsp; probably classify my audience as a
 group of people with an uncanny devotion to staying abreast of the 
utterly absurd.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7889ce;">CH:</span> </strong>I read a 
great quote on Penny Arcade a few weeks ago that immediately made me 
think of Problem Sleuth. Tycho said that the role of a gamemaster is “to
 uphold the beautiful lie that a system, even a system with embedded<br>
randomness, is at play.” How do you maintain that lie?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH:</strong></span> The demands
 of maintaining that lie are especially present in crafting a tale like 
Problem Sleuth. For the majority of the story I didn’t know where it was
 going, and the interactive nature of it sort of has it sprawling on 
endlessly. The best way to establish the appearance that order is at 
work is to start forging connections between things which initially 
appeared arbitrary, and in fact probably were arbitrary.</p>
<p>I would look at it like this, at least if you are in the position of 
having to make a story the way Problem Sleuth is made. Imagine you are 
MacGyver about to go on a mission. But you are not told what that 
mission is. It might not even be violent. You might just need to deliver
 some groceries to an old lady or something, and then do some laundry. 
Or you might have to save the president. Who knows!</p>
<p>So what do you take on this mystery mission? What combination of 
elements allows you to be prepared for almost any development? Maybe 
components of a bomb seem like a given, but it’s more likely that you 
will find you have to use those components in completely unexpected ways
 and just roll with it.</p>
<p>Perhaps there actually is an optimal solution for the “MacGyver 
Mystery Mission” (MMM) problem. My solution however appears to be to 
lean heavily on things like candy corn, jazz instruments, particle board
 desks, and stone<br>
busts of Ben Stiller.</p>
<p>In thinking about it just now, it strikes me that, astonishingly, for
 every “solution list” to the MMM problem, there will always be some 
potential story and some potential unifying logic to rationally link 
every element on the list. Not only gracefully, but in a way that 
appears to have been engineered from the very start. Though of course 
this is an illusion. This is the lie.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7889ce;">CH:</span> </strong>When you’re
 planning for a comic like this, do you do anything that could be 
traditionally thought of as “game design”? Are there design documents?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH:</strong></span> The only 
thing that may resemble design docs would be an occasional map I might 
sketch to get a better feel for geography before plunging headlong 
through locked doors. Even so I don’t tend to draw very elaborate maps 
all at once. For instance before he heads into his back room hideout, 
I’ll draw that room, and that room may contain a door. I may draw what’s
 on the other side of that door too, or, more likely, I may say “I’ll 
think of what’s in there later.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7889ce;">CH:</span> </strong>Where does the user input end and the writing begin?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7889ce;">AH:</span> </strong>The user input ends with the period that may or may not have been supplied at the end of the user’s submitted command.</p>
<p>Really from there I take over. Most of the commands are fairly 
trivial actions, but often lead to non-trivial plot swings which I have 
designed either 1) on the fly, or 2) in advance by tens or hundreds of 
pages, and am using the current<br>
command as either an ad hoc catalyst for it, or had anticipated such a 
command would likely be submitted and devised a contingency for it.</p>
<p>But that said, I don’t want to marginalize user input’s role in 
forming the story either. Some things, many things, enter the story that
 I just did not anticipate. Catch phrases especially seem to blossom 
through user commands. Things like “shit just got real”, or “punch ___ 
in snout to establish superiority”, or “ride ___ like mechanical bull”. 
All those and<br>
plenty more were originally authored by random users, who’s names I’ve 
long forgotten or never even knew, and unfortunately are relegated to a 
great pool of anonymous yet critical contributors to this story.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong></span> What is 
your work schedule like? Do you set aside time in the week specifically 
for Problem Sleuth, or are you essentially “on call” for the game?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH:</strong></span> I usually 
submit updates every day. I look at the new commands that have cropped 
up and make a few selections and execute the results.</p>
<p>It may seem like an intensive work schedule but I approach the 
process in a rather leisurely way. There are frequently commands that 
take less than a minute to produce. The animated commands take longer of
 course, but I’m more judicious with my time on those, and how often I 
employ them.</p>
<p>I update a lot because, for one, I probably entertain myself with the
 process even more than anyone out there reading it, but more 
importantly, I’ve learned by now that if I don’t keep riding herd on 
this story, it would go on forever.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong></span> What software/services do you use to manage your comic?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH:</strong></span> Since the website is called MS Paint Adventures, the answer should be obvious: I use Adobe Photoshop CS3.</p>
<p>I started out in MS Paint originally to cash in on this exciting 
internet “ugly pixel chic” or whatever it is. Maybe it’s really “this 
looks like shit but it’s still funny, and maybe that’s kinda part of why
 it’s funny chic.” Anyway, I promptly stopped using MS Paint when I 
discovered none of those things were actually legitimate chics.</p>
<p>I also stopped using it because MS Paint is not very good. The 
self-imposed gimmick serves no purpose when I am bearing the sole brunt 
of the gimmick, in private. It’s like saying I want to break the world 
record for push-ups with<br>
one hand tied behind my back. But in a dark room. No one can watch. You 
may only stand outside the door and listen in on the grunting my labors 
produce.</p>
<p>So I switched to Photoshop. Note this switch was almost 
instantaneous. But I kept the name of the “game” because I didn’t care 
enough to change it. Also it wasn’t really as “big a deal” back then. It
 probably still isn’t as “big a deal” now, come to think of it. Really, 
when can a story about stick figure detectives stuck in their offices 
ever be described<br>
as a “big deal”? These are difficult questions to answer.</p>
<p>I like to think I have one of the highest SDNTBSC ratios (Shittiest 
Domain Name To Best Site Content) on the internet. There might be others
 that are higher, I don’t know. Like maybe there is a website called 
slutsploitation-skankgrotto.com or something. And when you visit that 
site, your doorbell rings immediately and you go out to find a puppy on 
your front stoop. That one would have me beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong></span> Do you think MS Paint Adventures would work in a more traditional medium - as a book, for example?</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>AH: </strong></span>I’m sort of
 exploring that right now. I think it could work. But it’s going to be 
one hell of a reformatting project, and would likely yield a pretty 
outlandish looking piece of literature. Which might actually be the best
 reason to pursue it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #7889ce;"><strong>CH:</strong> </span>And finally: What’s with all the whores?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #7889ce;">AH:</span> </strong>Well when 
you’ve been cooped up in a sweltering office, sleuthing up the problems 
and cracking the weird puzzle shit all day, a hard boiled fella is going
 to be fixing for a little company. And his first impulse ain’t gonna be
 to dial up a party clown if you understand my meaning.</p>
<blockquote><p>Problem Sleuth began in March, and currently contains 
nearly 1400 comics inspired by crowdsourced commands. It will conclude 
in the coming months, but the command line is still open for business.
