    <p>
	<strong>Homestuck</strong>. From 2009 to 2016, it was an online 
phenomenon, a webcomic both minimalist and innovative, groundbreaking 
yet old-school, simple enough to follow the format of a classic 
role-playing game, but complex enough to earn comparisons to James 
Joyce’s <em>Ulysses.</em></p>
<p>
	It was also very, very difficult to explain what <strong>Homestuck</strong> was actually <em>about</em>
 to new readers. But now there’s a chance for new readers to jump on 
board – or longtime fans to relive the saga from the beginning, complete
 with creator commentary.</p>
<p>
	To <em>try</em> to explain it – <strong>Homestuck </strong>is an ever-expanding story that takes its inspiration from such deadpan old-school role-playing video games as <em>EarthBound </em>(“Earth”
 = “Home,” “Bound” = “Stuck,” get it?). The protagonists, frequently 
drawn without arms unless they needed them, move about their minimalist 
environments (frequently guided by reader suggestions in the first year)
 as the story unfolds through video-game-type narration, instant 
messaging, GIFs, the occasional Flash animation or playable 
mini-game…and so on, as the story gradually builds to the destruction of
 all reality, several times over.</p>
<p>
	That is a grotesquely oversimplified version of it, but part of the appeal of <strong>Homestuck</strong>
 is watching it unfold and go crazier and crazier - and while the full, 
8,000+-page story is still online at mspaintadventures.com, VIZ Media 
has taken on the task of bringing this madness to widespread hard-copy 
form in a new series of hardcovers, launching on April 13, the ninth 
anniversary of the first strip’s posting. The first volume covers the 
first two “acts” of <strong>Homestuck</strong>, along with creator 
commentary that illustrates the evolution of the storyline, and the 
seemingly-random elements that did - or didn’t - wind up paying off 
later.</p>

<p>
	With <strong>Homestuck</strong> poised to reach an all-new audience, 
Newsarama asked series creator Andrew Hussie about the unique challenges
 of translating the strip into the print format, the potential for 
online storytelling, and much more. The answers he provided were not 
exactly straight-faced.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Newsarama</strong>: Andrew, my first reaction to seeing <strong>Homestuck</strong> collected like this was...well, "How the hell are they going to do <em>that</em>?!"
 And actually, that's a running part of your commentary in the book.What
 were some of the biggest challenges in reformatting the series into a 
print medium, let alone going back and reviewing your work from a decade
 ago?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>: The biggest reformatting challenges 
weren't mine to solve. A guy named Chris took all the stuff from the 
website and turned them into page layouts for the books. He did a very 
good job.</p>
<p>
	So, if there were challenges in reformatting the work, I wasn't the one
 who solved those problems, he was. Generally speaking, I don't solve 
problems, I just create them.</p>
<p>
	Looking back on my work as I make notes for the books has been a good 
experience. I get to read everything all over again, including lots of 
stuff I forgot about. Most of it is incredibly funny and good. I don't 
think I ever laugh at stuff as much as the stuff I made myself. I mean, 
other people's stuff is fine. It's just not quite as good.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: &nbsp;How did the collections from VIZ come about, and what's the experience been like working with them?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: The VIZ people are great, and are all true professionals when it comes to manga and anime. That's why <strong>Homestuck</strong> was the perfect fit here. You'll never see a better anime than <strong>Homestuck</strong>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: Have you had any talk about reprinting your other MS Paint Adventures in hard-copy form?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: There are old editions of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>
 floating around out there. You can probably buy used copies on Amazon 
for like $100 each. But maybe we'll make new and better editions of 
those for VIZ too, who knows.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: What's been the most unexpected way that <strong>Homestuck</strong> has changed your life and career?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: All of the ways it changed my life and career 
were mostly expected. Which is what makes it so weird that I decided to 
do all this deliberately.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: The MS Paint Adventure format taps into an 
intriguing aspect of many old-school computer and video games, which is 
the concept of an intimate narrative branching out into something very 
epic and crazy, which I say as someone who in no way wasted many hours 
last summer watching playthroughs of <em>Startropics</em> and for some reason <em>Thomas M. Disch’s AMNESIA</em> on YouTube.</p>
<p>
	What, for you, are the most unique storytelling advantages and 
challenges of this format, and what do you feel current games could 
learn from older examples?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: The advantage was just that it was a fast and 
fun way of putting a whimsical story together. I drew fast, put it up, 
and asked people what comes next. The result is a feeling that those old
 games give you, a sense of just messing around stupidly and not really 
going anywhere, but it's fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>
	That's not how you make games like that, though. Making a game is a 
much more rigorous and controlled process. So, the end result for the 
reader/player is similar. But the process is totally different. I'm just
 simulating a game improvisational-ly, sort of like a dungeon master.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: How many volumes do you project the collected <strong>Homestuck</strong> ultimately running?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: I don't know, but it will probably take up an entire shelf.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: What are some aspects of multimedia 
storytelling you'd like to see explored, both in terms of what you're 
creating, and from other creators? It often feels like there's a lot of 
untapped potential out there.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: I tried to make <strong>Homestuck</strong> the thing that taps all the untapped potential. At least when it comes to the web format, circa 2009-2016.<br>
	I don't know if you could do much more with it than was done, unless 
you start grasping at straws for new ridiculous things to try out. Which
 <strong>Homestuck</strong> did a lot of itself, the further it went along. There's always more to try.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: Because so much of the story was driven by 
reader input and questions, and in the interest of asking the dumbest 
question possible, what would happen if John and friends got into a 
fistfight with Homestar Runner?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: It sounds like a very sad and completely 
unnecessary level of escalation has taken place. I would hope they could
 all work out their differences before it comes to that.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: What's next for you?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: I'll probably just keep making things.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Nrama</strong>: Anything else you'd like to talk about that we haven't discussed yet?</p>
<p>
	<strong>Hussie</strong>: Yes. We haven't discussed horses yet. I'd like to talk about horses.</p>
