                            <p><em><a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/" target="_blank">MS Paint
                                Adventures</a></em> began as a weird webcomic where reader suggestions dictated the
                                action every day, leading to predictably silly ends. Creator <strong>Andrew
                                    Hussie</strong> ran several stories there in the guise of <strong>old pictorial text
                                    adventure games</strong> (think <em>King’s Quest</em>,
                                if your memory goes back that far). In April 2009, three days after
                                concluding the epic detective story/game Problem Sleuth, he jumped right
                                into his current project: <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6"
                                                             target="_blank"><em><strong>Homestuck</strong></em></a>.
                                That’s when everything started to change.</p>
                            <p>Homestuck is about four 13-year-old internet friends trying to play <strong>a computer
                                game that will either save or destroy the world</strong>.
                                It is sprawling and complex, dumb and hilarious, and full of the most
                                fiendishly intricate references to the basest turds of pop culture. It’s
                                about the internet — cliques and fandoms, the good stuff and the icky
                                stuff. In Hussie’s own words, Homestuck is “made of pure internet”.</p>
                            <p>Oh, and it has easily <strong>a million daily readers</strong>, raised nearly <strong>$2
                                million on Kickstarter</strong>, and is <strong>actually really good</strong>. I have
                                some experience with weirdly popular youth-oriented videogame-referencing epics (i.e. I
                                created the <em><strong>Scott Pilgrim</strong></em> series), so after plowing through
                                <em>Homestuck</em> (twice!) I set out to ask Andrew Hussie some of the burning questions
                                on my mind.
                            </p>
                            <div style="text-align: center">
                                <img src="images/2reunite.jpg"

                            <p>If you’ve been to a comic convention lately and seen a giant group of
                                teenagers giggling about something you don’t understand, they were
                                almost certainly <em>Homestuck</em> fans. Right now Hussie’s running a <a
                                        href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game"
                                        target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>
                                to produce a professional Homestuck-derived computer game and as of
                                this writing it’s raised $2 MILLION DOLLARS. This whole phenomenon was
                                so interesting to me that, a little over a year ago, I delved into the
                                seemingly-impenetrable story itself, starting with <a
                                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6" target="_blank">page one</a>… all
                                the way to page five-thousand.</p>
                            <p>Yes, <em>Homestuck</em> is long, and it keeps getting longer (it’s
                                currently ongoing, although Hussie promises the end is in sight). It’s
                                verbose. It’s mysterious. While we could quibble all day about whether
                                it is or isn’t a comic, here’s what it is: pictures and words. There’s
                                no speech balloons. Each “page” is generally one panel. Sometimes
                                there’s text — often thousands of words presented as a chat log between
                                two or more characters. Sometimes there’s just artwork, wordless action,
                                for many pages in a row. Some pages are animated .gifs. Some pages are a
                                full-blown 15-minute, lavishly-animated cartoon features. Some pages
                                take the form of an honest-to-god playable video game.</p>
                            <p>The most important thing about <em>Homestuck</em> is, in this
                                reader’s opinion, that it’s excellent. It’s a massive undertaking of
                                deftly-handled long-term serialized storytelling. It’s well-written and
                                thoughtful. It has things to say. It takes weeks and weeks to read the
                                whole thing (to date), and it certainly isn’t for everyone, but it’s as
                                much worth your time as any comic I can think of. What is the deal with
                                Homestuck and Andrew Hussie? Read on to find out.</p>
                            <p><strong>BRYAN LEE O’MALLEY: The general premise of <em>MSPA</em> was,
                                initially, making fun of the dumb silliness of text parser adventure
                                games. But those largely stopped being made in, like, 1989. So for me,
                                the big cognitive dissonance at first was: here’s a story presented in a
                                text parser format attracting a massive audience of teens. Most of
                                these kids literally could not have been born in the era when text
                                parser games were even a thing at all. So… what are your readers taking
                                from this? Are they just investing themselves in the meat of the story
                                and kind of glossing over the presentational/meta stuff? Do you think
                                they even know or care that the text parser is an archaic gaming
                                interface — is it now just a “<em>Homestuck</em> thing” to the younger readers?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>ANDREW HUSSIE:</strong> The commands and mock-text parser stuff were concepts in
                                much better alignment with the story and website in early <em>Homestuck</em>
                                and in the stories before it, when the readers would submit those
                                commands and I would pick one and draw the response — where I was
                                literally functioning as the text parser myself. As <em>Homestuck</em>
                                went on, and the user submission system was retired (quite necessarily,
                                about a year into it), the text command system has become a little more
                                esoteric. A lot of the commands started getting a little lofty or
                                abstract, or tied to no character in particular (like “Descend.”), or
                                just a blank “==&gt;” when all we really need to do sometimes is turn
                                the damn page. It’s funny how the invisible action of turning the page
                                is something that requires no consideration from the author of a typical
                                book, but it always needs some thought in this case. In a way these
                                commands really do start becoming “just a quirky Homestuck thing,” even
                                if that’s all they ever were in the minds of very young readers. A lot
                                of the time the commands to me seem to serve as a simple title for a
                                page.</p>
                            <p>Before <em>Homestuck</em>, I think the site really did tend to
                                attract more people in [their 30s] or a bit younger, due to a much more
                                clearly telegraphed parody of text adventure games and those people
                                would dig it for that reason — the nostalgia and novelty surrounding
                                that particular storytelling mechanism. But <em>Homestuck</em> added a
                                lot more elements, more engaging story and characters, very much in the
                                vein of young adult content, and as such has attracted many very young
                                readers. For most of them, I do think the text adventure elements were
                                either lost on them or were just something that had no appeal other than
                                something that is an acquired taste — things they eventually learned
                                must be embraced as part of the overall “Homestuck experience.” But at
                                the onset, that archaic gaming parody stuff, and the slow, peculiar
                                pacing it entails, tends to just be one of the many, many barriers to
                                overcome in engaging with this and learning how to enjoy it. I couldn’t
                                even count how many times I’ve read something like “OK I’ve tried to
                                read this thing like five times and just never really got it. But the <em>sixth</em>
                                time, oh man, I finally pushed through the early stuff somehow and now I
                                am A Homestuck.” And then all successive posts on their tumblr seem to
                                be nothing but photos of themselves wearing horns or something.</p>
                            <p>So in response to the general question you asked, how I feel about
                                that, it’s a combination of being highly amusing and quite amazing. Once
                                that conversion happens, it often seems to be absolute. Like the things
                                that were once impediments to becoming invested in the story seem to
                                now be fully embraced, and even celebrated whenever those elements
                                resurface. Maybe it’s that the harder you have to work to figure
                                something out, and the more concentration you have to apply, the more
                                devoted you become once it all finally clicks and you get it.</p>

                                <strong>O’MALLEY: I guess the next topic that grabs me is “Internet Friends.” The four
                                    main characters in <em>Homestuck</em>
                                    have the most relatable internet friendships I’ve ever seen in fiction.
                                    It’s a new kind of relationship that you capture really accurately. The
                                    characters are best friends, but they haven’t technically met, and they
                                    only ever interact through this chat medium. And this is all presented
                                    via communication interfaces that feel much more 1999 than 2009. I mean,
                                    “Trollian” the chat client is I assume a riff on Trillian, and
                                    Pesterchum feels more like ICQ than anything. It brings me rushing right
                                    back to my earliest days online.</strong></p><strong>
                        </strong>
                            <p><strong>What was it like to start writing these characters
                                in 2009, and how much of the early chat logs grew out of your own online
                                relationships?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> The instant messaging style definitely draws
                                from 1999 more than 2009. AIM and ICQ rather than Skype and whatnot.
                                This too is a bit of a technological throwback, like so much of the
                                gaming satire. But that said, even though the apps are all different and
                                conventions have morphed, there isn’t <em>that</em> much that’s changed
                                about talking to friends on a computer via text. It’s a type of
                                interaction which has given rise to some totally distinct kinds of
                                social relationships, blossoming out of nowhere in the late ’90s, early
                                2000s, and they have actually become the defining types of relationships
                                for so many young people today. It’s almost unbelievable to consider
                                how many young people there are now who consider their best friends to
                                be people online, who they’ve never met.</p>
                            <p>That is I’m sure a major feature of the story that has resonated with
                                many readers, that it reflects those types of relationships somewhat
                                accurately. It’s a quirky kind of friendship, ones built mostly on text
                                exchanges. Those relationships, especially for those who don’t feel very
                                socially dynamic in real life, can develop more quickly and can often
                                feel stronger than real life ones. Maybe because it’s easier to find
                                people you connect with better from the internet pool, or that
                                conversing this way diminishes some of the social barriers that real
                                life interaction involves. Whatever it is, it tends to create some
                                pretty strong bonds, and that’s become standard these days. But the
                                other defining feature of those relationships is, unless you live
                                somewhat nearby, obviously you never get to actually be around that
                                person. So these friendships, while strong, can also be primarily
                                characterized by an inevitable sense of long term separation and
                                alienation. The fact that meeting is not practical or sometimes
                                impossible, especially with the very strong friendships, kind of turns
                                into the elephant in the room for that relationship. When will they get
                                to meet, or will they ever, can become the operative question and a
                                source of frustration.</p>
                            <p>I’m sure that element in these relationships has led to the various themes of alienation
                                found throughout <em>Homestuck</em>,
                                contributing to some of the more melancholy material. Meetings between
                                the kids do not happen for quite a long time, and it’s fairly
                                significant and usually feels special when they do. There are a bunch of
                                frustrating near-misses. All that stuff just keeps reminding people
                                what it’s like to have such relationships. The domestic situations of
                                the kids are also very isolated and kind of empty. When they get in the
                                game, they continue being isolated on their own planets and keep
                                corresponding through the internet. You find themes of alienation
                                wherever you look and it all points to what it feels like having your
                                most important relationships conducted through the internet.</p>
                            <p>The trolls are a larger group and their dynamic is a little more
                                “modern internet” than the kids, I think. In the early days of the
                                internet it was more common for internet relationships to be only like
                                those between the kids, but that was before the Facebook explosion and
                                all that, which completely tangled real life socialization with the
                                internet as the cultural norm. So you have some trolls who are friends
                                with trolls who live far away and they’ve never met, but also some who
                                are neighbors or live nearby, but they still all communicate with each
                                other on the net as one big group of friends. It’s a much more
                                contemporary sort of internet clique. It is also maybe a little more
                                realistic, with respect to the size and age of the group, in that it
                                generates much more drama and emotional theatrics.</p>
                            <p>I have experience with internet friendships from back when they were a
                                little more new to society, like late ’90s to early 2000s. When I was
                                13, obviously all this was pure science fiction. I somewhat draw from my
                                experience with how these types of online relationships and social
                                interactions universally work, but also it comes from observation of how
                                others engage with each other online, those younger than me or in
                                different situations than I ever was. Mainly my experience guides the
                                rhythm and feel for this sort of repartee, the jokey, rambling, casual
                                quality to it all. And that style became responsible for the genetic
                                makeup of how the entire story was built, how the vast majority of the
                                story’s text reads, how characters are shaped and info is revealed and
                                the plot is advanced. It’s one of the things that make the story a
                                winding road. It’s an outcome that’s self-evidently encoded in the
                                premise when you say, “Time to make a story where character interactions
                                are driven exclusively by rambling, true to life chat logs.”</p>

                                    by the use of chat logs? To me it adds a weird poignancy that later,
                                    even when they’re standing in front of each other, they kind of have to
                                    use the internet to communicate.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I don’t think I have ever said, “AUGH why
                                can’t I just make a damn speech bubble??” The characters always spend so
                                much time apart that it’s natural to just keep them talking on
                                computers. Times where they’re not, it gives me interesting chances to
                                play with the rules a bit, or devise new dialogue mechanisms that grow
                                out of the old ones. Like, one rule is they can always talk directly to a
                                sprite because they’re just game constructs, like guides. But sometimes
                                characters prototype themselves and become sprites. So you have those
                                few cases where characters directly talk to each other. Then you have
                                dream bubble mechanics, which kind of cheat. They tend to start out as
                                memories, like flashbacks, of characters talking online. But then when
                                they remember, and start walking around the dream and stand face to face
                                with others, they just keep talking out loud, using the same pesterlog
                                convention as if they’re still typing. They even continue using their
                                typing syntax and emoticons and stuff when they speak out loud.</p>
                            <p>Also waaay down the road I finally did invent a true mechanism for
                                face-to-face dialog. Called “dialoglogs.” But they can only be earned
                                after achieving a very high level, becoming a god, and even then
                                progressing a little higher than that to unlock the achievement of
                                simple dialogue without a chat client. This is itself a gag.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: How did you come to this format? What prompted you
                                to do a story about internet friends told in this internetty multimedia
                                format? It looks simple and elegant from here, but was it stumbled on or
                                was it hard-won?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> It was a major, long term case of one thing leading to another,
                                all very organically. <em>Homestuck</em> was just: <a
                                        href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4" target="_blank"><em>Problem
                                    Sleuth</em></a>
                                plus a little more of a story, try adding a dialog system, try adding
                                Flash animation, see what happens. There was also the different premise;
                                where Problem Sleuth was “detectives in offices,” <em>Homestuck</em> was “kids in
                                houses.” When people asked me what I was doing next, that’s how I would put it:
                                “Something with kids in houses.”</p>
                            <p>A lot of things about it were preconceived, like the four kids and
                                what they’d basically be like, some game rules, house building stuff,
                                creation myth stuff. But just as much if not more arose through the
                                process, like the trolls, carapace people and dream selves and god
                                tiers, points of execution like huge flash movies which I never thought
                                I’d do, playable games… the list is endless.</p>
                            <p>So yeah, a story about kids on the internet, that is told in a way that is like, <em>made
                                of pure internet</em>,
                                is something arrived at pretty organically and not something I can say I
                                envisioned before starting all at once. Making something that really
                                feels like it belongs on the internet, something that seems to actually
                                understand it exists on the internet, involves doing quite a lot of
                                things. The media exploration is part of it, but also the self aware
                                elements I think, where the connection between the reader/fandom and the
                                story is always alive and palpable.</p>

                                <strong>O’MALLEY: To recap, <em>Problem Sleuth</em> was about a detective stuck in his
                                    office. <em>Homestuck</em>
                                    starts with a kid stuck in his house. And for the first couple hundred
                                    pages that’s all it seems to be — but then it grows and grows. There’s a
                                    whole world in there. It gets big and weird and intense. Reading it a
                                    second time, I start to see the seams of where stuff was probably made
                                    up as you were going along, but on a first read through, the big reveals
                                    not only blew me away but seemed to have been in place from the first
                                    page. I think this mostly means you’re a great writer of serial fiction
                                    and you think well on your feet.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> Thanks for saying so! Dexterity is possibly
                                part of the answer, but the whole subject of “what was planned when” is
                                very tricky. Do all authors have every single idea totally hammered out
                                before they begin writing a novel? Of course not. Some things like
                                keystone ideas are planned well in advance of the first page. Others
                                emerge organically from the process. Anything that is introduced
                                spontaneously can be smoothed out and heavily disguised with the luxury
                                of an editing phase, but this here is essentially glass box
                                storytelling. You’re seeing how it’s being made as I go, and every
                                single decision is committed to absolutely once it’s on the site, with
                                no retconning ever. Nothing is ever written or drawn in advance; there’s
                                no “buffer,” only a mental outline of ideas and key plot points to
                                cover which is all executed little by little. So when people look into
                                the glass box and the next thing that comes out makes them say “holy
                                s***, was that planned?” the answer is almost always, “that’s a
                                complicated subject.”</p>
                            <p>When did the idea need to take shape for it to be considered planned
                                development? A month in advance? A year? How exactly do we profile the
                                genesis of an idea? Do we draw a tight circle around a particular
                                “eureka moment?” Or is it sometimes a much wider circumference? Could
                                you circle an entire year, and say, “There. That’s when I had the idea.”
                                Sometimes I find myself likening the birth of an idea or a vision to a
                                slow gathering of storm clouds. They accumulate, they brood in the
                                distance, always getting closer. It’s ominous, something you can’t
                                escape from rather than something you’re actively trying to precipitate.
                                Then it’s finally there, and you have no choice. You have to do it.
                                That cloud accumulation often <em>is</em> the planning process. And it
                                happens while you’re building a story just as often as before you begin.
                                Maybe more often. Sometimes those little clues at the beginning, or
                                repeated themes that mount throughout which all scream foreshadowing for
                                certain payoffs, those were actually artifacts of the accumulation
                                which lead to the full realization of the idea. It’s not really just
                                “retroactive foreshadowing” either, though that can also be a device in
                                play. It’s more like listening carefully to the marble of the story and
                                determining how it wants to be carved, when I was also the one who
                                created the raw slab of marble in the first place.</p>
                            <p>Less abstractly, there were definitely a lot of things nailed down
                                before page one. The concept of the game as a creation myth, a lot of
                                the game rules, stuff like that. So even though there’s plenty of
                                thinking on my feet, and allowing other major elements coalesce as I go,
                                there were still always some huge plot beacons I was always marching
                                toward in some way with every page. The fact that there’s clear order
                                driving the most major revelations at the heart of the story probably
                                strengthens the illusion that every other bit of it is just as
                                maniacally calculated as well. Working on something like this borrows
                                somewhat from the art of being an improv comic. You probably go into the
                                act with some major, high level guidelines for the performance no
                                matter what people want you to do, but also have a lot of room and
                                dexterity to adjust to the specifics, and it’s a whole discipline unto
                                itself knowing how to make those adjustments in a way that seems natural
                                or even planned and rehearsed.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: I identify strongly with your “gathering storm
                                clouds” metaphor for ideas coalescing. That’s a very evocative way of
                                putting it.</strong></p><strong>
                        </strong>
                            <p><strong>I was going to ask how much time elapsed between the end of <em>Problem
                                Sleuth</em> and beginning of <em>Homestuck</em>,
                                but I just checked the logs and it was under a week, which is nuts.
                                Were you just brimming with ideas for the new story during the last
                                weeks/months of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>? I know I’m constantly coming up with big plans
                                for the next story when I should be finishing the current story.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I began <em>Homestuck</em> on 4/13, but I began the <em>Homestuck</em>
                                Beta on 4/10. That was three days after <em>Problem Sleuth</em> ended. A huge part of
                                the <em>MSPA</em>
                                exercise has been to just throw myself into it no matter what, whether
                                I’m “ready” or not, and then just never stop. The challenge is always to
                                take whatever idea I have for what’s next, do it <em>now</em>, and somehow make it work,
                                even if it’s kind of stupid or just totally nuts.</p>
                            <p>Even though there was almost a nonexistent gap between <em>Problem Sleuth</em> and <em>Homestuck</em>,
                                there was still definitely a planning phase for <em>Homestuck</em> going on at the tail
                                end of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>.
                                It was much more like that slow accumulation of storm clouds I
                                described earlier. It all kind of coalesced very ominously over the
                                final months of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>, then it was over, and it wasn’t
                                really a matter of hopping over to the next fun story casually. It was
                                more a matter of having no choice, and then beginning the climb on a new
                                monstrous project that was undoubtedly going to take over my life and
                                that of many others in ways I couldn’t quite imagine, but still
                                basically understood on some level.</p>

                                <strong>O’MALLEY: What about pacing? It always feels very deliberate
                                    throughout. I think on multiple occasions you tease us with fragments of
                                    a character literally hundreds of pages before fully revealing them.
                                    The buildup always feels very measured. Are you buying time to make new
                                    stuff up? Or do you have stuff made up and just take your time spooling
                                    it out?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE: </strong>I try to put myself in the shoes of readers a
                                lot when making it, especially ones who approach it [via the archives].
                                Probably because the majority of people who will ever read it will read
                                it that way (including most current readers, who have had to catch up
                                through five acts before following along.) So when I make decisions on
                                how to pace certain things, when to show payoffs and big reveals, what
                                points to foreshadow and how heavily, I usually do all that with an eye
                                toward the experience of someone reading “archivally.” I think the whole
                                thing gels together better when read that way. Novelty of everything
                                stays fresher throughout, certain plot points and details stay afloat in
                                your mind better, all that helps catalyze a quality impact for the more
                                striking sequences and surprising reveals when they do happen. It
                                sounds like these factors may have benefited your experience, which is
                                always nice to hear.</p>
                            <p>I honestly think this is one reason why it’s exploded. Large amounts
                                of people are finally catching up with the whole thing I pictured it
                                would be, receiving all the crazy s*** as one massive shot of
                                adrenaline, confusion and media titillation, and responding well to it.</p>
                            <p>I still throw plenty of bones to serial readers, though. On a
                                day-to-day basis, even if we aren’t blasting off to plot resolutions as
                                quickly as serial readers will often demand, there’s always something
                                funny or entertaining going on, like gags, fun character interactions,
                                various shoutouts to things emerging from the fandom which then become
                                woven into the fabric of Homestuck lore, and so on. Advancement is
                                always present in subtle ways, sometimes concealed inside blocks of
                                casual banter, or lurking passively in a visual. We learn a little

                            <p>The bottom line on pacing I think is: I am very patient. Possibly
                                even to a fault. But if you seek to tell stories that involve intrigue,
                                particularly which involve highly combustible payoffs, I think it’s
                                better to err on the side of patience. There is always a right time to
                                reveal something.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: This seems like a good segue into process. I want
                                to start with the basics: What is your day like? What is your week like?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I think in the last year or so it’s fair to say I’ve <em>kiiiiiind </em>of
                                eased up on the nonstop grind. But I’ll rewind the clock to, say, 2010,
                                when I was definitely in the full throes of Homestuck’s silly climb.
                                There just isn’t an answer to the question that isn’t “literally every
                                waking hour” creating this thing. The day was like this: I’d wake up.
                                Read some emails, see what people are saying about the story here and
                                there, then just get to work. This most often involved writing first,
                                either a pesterlog or the little sub-panel blurbs. I’d stack up the
                                writing for all the panels I wanted to make for that batch, then I’d
                                draw them or mess around with an existing art file to quick-and-dirty
                                something out.</p>
                            <p>The faster the panels were made, the more I’d post in a day. If
                                panels were coming quick, that could have been a 10-20-page day. If the
                                panels were simple, but very text-heavy, then fewer. But the shortcuts
                                and time saved were always immediately reinvested into further work on
                                the story. Like, a lot of days there would be update batches, like the
                                early evening batch, then I’d eat or something, then work on the late
                                night batch and post all those at 4am or something. The bottom line is
                                there were never daily quotas or milestones or anything like a schedule.
                                It was just: get as much done as quickly as possible, post it, then
                                almost immediately begin working on more.</p>
                            <p>Which sounds ludicrous, but that regimen was always inseparable from
                                the product in my mind. It also helped that for the most part, any given
                                slew of panels is relatively easy for me, embodies a bunch of
                                entertaining ideas I’d been wanting to bring to light often for some
                                time already, and serves as an esoteric form of personal entertainment
                                when you factor in the dialog between the work and readers which the
                                instant output precipitates. The only type of work I’d ever call “hard”
                                was Flash work, and often that’s putting it really lightly. Those were
                                usually days, or a week, of not posting anything while working twice as
                                hard as usual, a lot of times actually sacrificing sleep which I never
                                tend to do otherwise, just to get the f***in’ things done. This isn’t
                                recommended. Actually, none of this is recommended.</p>

                                <strong>O’MALLEY: OK, so you have a work ethic that borders on (or
                                    brazenly charges into) crazytown. What portion of your day/week/month
                                    breaks down into note-making, writing, drawing, revising?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I’d break it down like this on average: 0%,
                                49.5%, 49.5%, 1%. Notes are almost nonexistent. I have a few scattered
                                one-word blips or phrases about this or that in my file, but that’s it.
                                One of the things about doing this constantly, like a full
                                mind-body-life thing, is it just seems to keep everything about the
                                story “alive” in my head all the time. I think if I did things like take
                                breaks or have a more sparse schedule, it would kind of fall apart in
                                my head and I’d have to resort to documents and flow charts and stuff,
                                or more realistically, just get fed up and quit. Revising is also very
                                light. The thing is supposed to be very light on editing and revision,
                                while always charging ahead.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: So would you say the dialog is basically stream-of-consciousness from
                                story beat to story beat?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> It was always fairly stream of
                                consciousness, which initially resulted from embracing chatlog style
                                repartee. It’s actually very useful from a “just get something on the
                                page and go from there” standpoint. There is a bit of refinement
                                sometimes, deleting some blocks, adding a line here and there. Usually
                                it’s pretty close to prime-time-ready from start to finish. Some dialogs
                                are more taxing and require serious thought if they’re more plot
                                critical, revealing stuff in just the right way, or involve gymnastics
                                with internally consistent timeline bulls***. Sometimes I have to go
                                back and add troll quirks, which can be terrible <em><strong>[note: the troll characters
                                    all speak/type in distinctive hacker-style lingo]</strong></em>. For some characters
                                I really quickly took to using a fan-made troll text conversion app.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: How far out do you work? Are you on the razor’s edge here? Do you
                                compose the day’s pages that very day and post them?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> Yep, it’s make pages, put ’em up. If there
                                were ink involved, the ink would literally not be dry on like 95% of all
                                pages the moment they went up. But there is also a living outline in my
                                head for what to do with the story for the next month’s worth of
                                updates or so. It’s often subject to change though. And almost
                                invariably, the events I picture take more time to execute than I
                                envision. Like often a week or more longer, but sometimes it takes
                                months longer to get to some particular thing I was picturing.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: You’ve said there are over a million <em>Homestuck</em>
                                readers. I’ll just scratch the surface by asking: when did you realize
                                it was getting crazy? And when did it go from being crazy online to
                                burgeoning into a real-world thing?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> The moment it went crazy was really
                                unmistakable and totally obvious even at the time. It was when I brought
                                the trolls into the picture. Really, not even that long into it,
                                either. Hivebent, the sub-act introducing them, was about 600 pages
                                long, and took a full summer to make. I think the existing fandom began
                                turning itself into an insane cyclone about halfway through and started
                                sucking more people into it. It was an extremely wild and contagious
                                phenomenon, fueled largely by fan art completely infesting places like
                                Tumblr and 4chan, and cosplayers starting to get a little feistier and
                                more widespread. The site always felt “pretty popular” to me, at least
                                by my own standards, since the end of Problem Sleuth. But that was the
                                first time where the element of true hysteria began to creep in for me.</p>
                            <p>Other than that, there was one other critical spike in my perception
                                of the hysteria, which I think was Otakon last summer. Before that, I’d
                                see a lot of photos of cosplayers here and there, but they were never in
                                groups bigger than 10 or 20. Photos coming out of that con had groups
                                of several hundred Homestuck cosplayers. And groups of that size have
                                been the trend in anime cons ever since. It was some weird critical mass
                                of cosplay that took place at that con and it never looked back. The
                                Homestuck cosplayers at anime cons seem to routinely outnumber all the
                                other types of cosplay combined, and as the people who don’t like it
                                often lament, <em>Homestuck</em> isn’t even<em> an anime</em>.</p>
                            <p>The photos that surfaced from Otakon had a mildly spooky feeling, and
                                I don’t think it was for just me. They were kind of passing around
                                Twitter, here and there, and it felt like people not following the thing
                                closely were caught off guard by it. Like, looking at something that
                                doesn’t register as a rational, understandable thing. Like, “uh… what
                                is… hmm. What? Did those 50 kids in the blue hoodies really all dress up
                                as the same character?” Really, my sense is that <em>Homestuck</em> as a
                                phenomenon seems to make some people legitimately nervous. I guess
                                because it really just doesn’t seem to make any sense. Especially to
                                those who don’t know anything about the story, try to understand it, go
                                to the first page of the site, and say “WHAT?”</p>

                                    nonstop for, like, a pretty long time now. How do you make your money?
                                    When did you start making enough to get by? For me there was a pretty
                                    specific window of time where it switched over from being “this is
                                    sh***y” to “this is OK now,” but it was to do with books and royalties
                                    and suddenly having enough books in print (four <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>s) for the
                                    math to finally be in my favor. I don’t know what the equivalent is for a Web

                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I’ve been entirely supported by <em>MSPA</em> since, I guess,
                                the latter half of <em>Problem Sleuth</em>, though things were still pretty lean back
                                then and stayed that way for the first year or two of <em>Homestuck</em>.
                                I don’t think it ever crossed my mind to think “this is sh***y” because
                                I was totally used to living that way forever, and I thought it was
                                totally cool being able to make “free money” with internet ads, which
                                stayed as the biggest source of revenue for a good while (it’s now
                                easily the smallest, though). But there was definitely a moment where it
                                crossed the line and became “this is definitely far from sh***y” and
                                that was also the critical fan spike I mentioned earlier, introducing
                                the trolls. I was still underestimating the profitability brewing under
                                the surface, though. I had the idea to make the zodiac shirts but
                                thought it would be a pretty niche item and didn’t want to bug my usual
                                shirt maker Topatoco with 12 new designs. So I got my own company, What
                                Pumpkin, to make a bunch, but woefully under ordered. We had a huge
                                amount of trouble keeping those shirts in stock and shipping out all the
                                orders for like a solid year after that. That’s pretty much been the
                                story of all merch since then; constantly underestimating steadily
                                growing demand. It was that way with the early runs of the god tier
                                stuff too.</p>
                            <p>I seem to have this knack for falling totally ass backwards into
                                highly marketable ideas, like the troll zodiac symbols. It really seems
                                like such a money making scam when you look at it. Like, taking these
                                icons that have been around forever, give them all one color which is
                                easy and cheap to print on a simple black shirt, associate them with
                                some distinctive characters, and also the zodiac which people can
                                intrinsically identify with (having a “patron troll”) then just slap it
                                on a bunch of merch and rake in the dough. The god tier stuff also felt
                                that way, 12 nice colorful icons, <em>also</em> associated with
                                particular characters, special powers etc., and canonically associated
                                with a particular garment, a hoodie (i.e. godhood), so any cynical
                                observer looks at it and can say, “Heh, look what bulls*** Hussie cooked
                                up to sell hoodies.” But honestly this is <em>always</em> accidental.
                                The ideas always just seemed cool to me, filling out the zodiac with
                                troll characters, fleshing out the full god tier system and such. I’ve
                                never actually put anything in the story to sell anything. But
                                throughout the entire ride, every time I turn around, I’m saying, “Oh,
                                whoops. Guess I gotta sell that now.”</p>
                            <p>When I started selling books, that also really kicked up the revenue.
                                And like you said, it starts stacking up with more books out. I have
                                five out now and that’s really adding up, and I’m barely even scratching
                                the surface of publishable content. Homestuck could have 10 books
                                alone, probably more. This is another one of those “completely
                                accidental moves of merchandising genius” on my part. Making a type of
                                story that is produced so quickly, that I can put out in a few years the
                                same number of books that might take someone else a decade to
                                stockpile. I very rarely have a palpable sense of how much work I’ve
                                actually done over the last few years until I’m sizing up the book
                                project. Then, once the magnitude of the bookmaking job begins to sink
                                in, I start muttering, “Oh my god, what have I done…”</p>

                                because I’m pretty well able to step outside of it and try to honestly
                                see what it looks like to random people. And what I see is something
                                that couldn’t possibly be less penetrable to casual understanding. I
                                think weighing the massive cult phenomenon that’s apparent in public,
                                against what the first page of the story looks like… that kind of says
                                it all. It just so perfectly “does not compute,” looking at this dinky
                                piece of s*** aliased drawing of a kid with a cake versus an army of
                                screaming teens in gray makeup. How do regular people even process that?
                                And the scary thing is, even figuring out how to reconcile that
                                disparity is barely even the beginning of “understanding it,” so I can
                                completely understand people giving up before even trying. In fact, I’d
                                probably do the same.</p>

                                    thoughts on hate?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> <em>Homestuck</em> kind of took a while to
                                accumulate honest-to-god haters. It’s probably for the exact same reason
                                there aren’t a lot of true “mehs” out there. It seems that most of the
                                haters have entered the hatedom through their antipathy toward the fans.
                                People’s irritation and loathing for the fandom’s antics always seems
                                to exacerbate any slight dislike of the story they have, and is really
                                often a catalyst that transmutes “meh” into full blown hate, for all
                                things <em>Homestuck </em>no matter how irrational or petty. Like… these idiots are
                                wearing gray makeup, I’m so pissed, let me just load up <em>MSPA</em> so I can confirm
                                and then rave about how bad this thing is. Oh god I was right ALL THESE JOKES SUCK!</p>
                            <p>I think those bother me a lot less because they’re so patently
                                irrational. The ones that are more frustrating tend to be the kind of
                                haters who once seemed like they were into it at some point, but one
                                thing or another soured them on it and now all of a sudden the whole
                                thing is crap, as if they previously were an unreliable witness of
                                content. I guess this is really something at the heart of haterism that
                                is almost unavoidable for any work. It takes time to deliver anything,
                                and for it to blossom into whatever it’s going to become and to reveal
                                its true statements. That almost always takes years, so it’s a natural
                                race against people’s attention spans, or even just the inscrutably
                                shifting terrain of their preferences. There are always going to be
                                things that people will want a story to become, and those preferences
                                always vary, so the story is always gonna cross some people no matter
                                what it does.</p>
                            <p>Where frustration as a creator comes into play is the factors that
                                exist outside of the pure text are almost never acknowledged, like rate
                                of delivery and shift of personal perspective. The hater always demands
                                absolute acknowledgement of the text’s intrinsic flaws, and there are no
                                factors whatsoever on the other side of the fence. As if a story is
                                nothing but raw data to be deconstructed, and not actually a million
                                different stories that come to life within a million different vehicles
                                of consciousness.</p>
                            <p>Generally they don’t affect my work habits, but I guess earlier this
                                year there was a period where I was feeling pretty dark about it. There
                                seemed to be a critical spike in Homestuck hate then, I guess because
                                the readership size finally cleared a certain threshold and some people
                                just couldn’t take it anymore. But the feeling isn’t really
                                characterized by increased doubt in what I’m doing, it’s more like a
                                kind of depression that says, “Why bother working hard to make good work
                                for idiots and a**holes???” But I guess that was a pretty small speed
                                bump because that didn’t last too long. Everything always seems to be in
                                the fast lane when it comes to MSPA, so I guess the funks might as well
                                be too. Now if people rail on it, it barely registers as anything to
                                me. Their bluster is the white noise of Wrong.</p>

                                    relationships, aka “shipping” — fans love this stuff. I wasn’t aware how
                                    much of a thing it had become until well into the <em>Scott Pilgrim </em>series,
                                    when I realized a ton of the fans had dismissed Ramona and were somehow
                                    fancifully giving Scott and Kim an ending together in their fan-brains.
                                    I started to play with that expectation in the second half of the
                                    series, at first playing with the theoretical idea of fanservice (like
                                    the swimsuit sequence and the girls-kissing stuff) and eventually
                                    realizing it was a real thing and having to steer the story back in the
                                    right direction (i.e. towards Ramona). I got a second chance to play
                                    with pairings when I wrote the videogame endings, which have Kim and
                                    Knives together, Scott with all the girls, Knives and Scott, etc.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> I think it became obvious it was going to be
                                a major, unignorable fan trend almost immediately after I introduced
                                the second character, therefore completing the very first shippable
                                pair. And by the nature of the work, it was just as obviously going to
                                be an inescapable presence in terms of the direction of the story. The
                                themes the story deals with usually flow in the path of least
                                resistance, as carved out by the forces of nature which are represented
                                by the greater interests and enthusiasms of the readership. And by
                                “dealing with” those themes I mean some strange combination of merciless
                                mockery, shameless indulgence, and outright glorification. Shipping
                                received that treatment too.</p>
                            <p>But the focus on shipping as a major cog in the story’s machinery
                                didn’t kick off until the trolls were introduced. Which is true of
                                plenty of other themes too. Really the introduction of the trolls is
                                when Homestuck busts open like a piñata in terms of what it would begin
                                to yield as an unapologetic examination of internet subcultures, and it
                                never really looked back. The candy was on the floor, and kids started
                                diving for it. I couldn’t put the candy back in if I wanted to. Before
                                the trolls, it was a somewhat more buttoned up narrative that, while
                                taking internet culture sincerely as a basis for telling a story, never
                                got all that specific on the subcultures. It stayed more general, mostly
                                exploring what it’s like for a bunch of “regular kids” to be friends on
                                the internet. But the trolls were more explicit representations of
                                facets of internet culture, usually something marginalized or
                                controversial, or something most people just want nothing to do with.
                                Like a troll who fetishizes weird stuff, a troll who’s literally a
                                juggalo, and a troll who embodies an interest in furries <em>and</em> shipping (for the
                                sake of efficiency). And that’s when shipping pretty much took over Homestuck.</p>
                            <p>This is a little misleading, though, because the reality of many
                                stories capturing the interest of young adults is that they will often
                                involve plenty of romance. And this is true of <em>Homestuck</em>, too.
                                It’s just that when these themes began to emerge in Homestuck, they did
                                so under the rubric of shipping. Relationships were usually presented
                                through that lens, and discussed using that terminology. Most of which,
                                to be fair, was completely made up by me (see: quadrants).</p>
                            <p>It also bears mentioning that one thing I think <em>Homestuck </em>has
                                always done is take marginalized internet cultures that most people
                                think are icky or incomprehensible or just completely laughable, and
                                sort of humanize those things. Or at least, slowly bring people around
                                on those things, where they stop being viewed as completely absurd or
                                untouchable, and become sort of insidiously normalized in spite of
                                everyone’s best efforts to keep that stuff on the fringe where it
                                belongs. Like, people who’ve been reading through its entire run, at the
                                beginning most of them would have decried shipping as something beneath
                                rational consideration, something only teen girl anime fans bother even
                                mentioning. But over time I noticed a lot of those people started
                                gradually being “converted,” and now so many people who were once
                                perfectly respectable from an internet culture standpoint, seem to
                                freely engage in discussions about shipping, using all the terms and
                                actually seriously evaluate hypothetical ships.</p>
                            <p>The same thing kind of happened with juggalo culture. Earlier
                                juggalos and their ways were seen as a complete joke, and early
                                references to them in Homestuck seemed like a gimmick designed to slam
                                Insane Clown Posse while accomplishing little else. But <em>Homestuck</em> just kept
                                riding juggalo humor so persistently, and to certain extent so sincerely, that the <em>Homestuck</em>
                                fandom now encompasses a legitimate sectarian offshoot of juggalo
                                culture. The ICP lexicon, clown makeup, Faygo, all that silly bulls***
                                is arguably as much a part of <em>Homestuck</em> culture as it a part of
                                the actual juggalo culture it’s supposedly mocking. Though if you look
                                closely, it hardly resembles mockery anymore.</p>

                                <strong>O’MALLEY: So now you’re making a real live Homestuck adventure
                                    game via Kickstarter. When did the idea for the game come up? Were you,
                                    like me, always wishing you could make an adventure game from the ages
                                    of ten to… never stopping?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> Yeah, I’ve always had the idea of making a
                                game bouncing around my head. I feel like anyone who played a lot of
                                games as a kid almost certainly wanted to make a game at some point, if
                                not actually imagining it as their profession some day. I didn’t always
                                want to make an adventure game. For a long time when I was a kid I
                                wanted to make a killer role-playing game. Like <em>Final Fantasy 3</em>…
                                <em>TWO!!!</em>
                                Something exactly like that. The idea for the big “game-making fantasy”
                                that is undoubtedly common among so many of us changed a lot for me,
                                like from platformer to RPG to adventure game, but I think the notion
                                was always there. I thought about making a <em>Problem Sleuth</em> game when I was
                                wrapping that story up. I probably would have, if I didn’t get so busy with <em>Homestuck</em>
                                right away.</p>
                            <p>So it was pretty much a no-brainer to see this Kickstarter wave and
                                pounce on that to actually bring to life this perma-fantasy of making a
                                game. Since the idea to do it was always there, it was just a matter of
                                actually obtaining the means, squaring up the time, and then actually
                                going through a process that is undoubtedly 10 times more difficult and
                                less glamorous than anyone who daydreams about game design ever
                                realizes. But I think I’ve prepared myself for those rigors pretty
                                adequately.</p>
                            <p><strong>O’MALLEY: The Kickstarter campaign is about to close with
                                over two million dollars. To me, this really vindicates the Homestuck
                                fandom as a powerful entity in its own right. This makes <em>Homestuck</em>
                                “real.” You’ve had no advertising, no corporate backing, just a real
                                groundswell of love and weird grey kids on Tumblr — proof of the power
                                word-of-mouth can have with something truly original and cool. So h</strong><strong>ow
                                excited are you right now?</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>HUSSIE:</strong> It’s an odd sensation of being extremely
                                excited, felt in very small pockets of space between perpetual activity
                                as I keep taking care of business. It’s hard to slow down to really
                                experience all that this represents because there’s still so much to do.
                                On a pure “holy s***” level, there’s a lot to be said for it. Let’s
                                face it, in normal person world, which at least I think is where I still
                                live, a million bucks is a lot of f***ing money. Like, remember how
                                that was always the <em>ultimate prize</em> in game shows and reality
                                TV, as if it was the absolutely undisputed benchmark for a dauntingly
                                inaccessible pile of wealth? The irreducible Pot of Gold. People would
                                sit in a chair and answer, like, 50 really hard questions and <em>fail</em> every day on
                                <em>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</em> Or in <em>Survivor</em>, you’d go to an island
                                full of a**holes and eat bugs and almost die for like two months just for a
                                <em>shot</em>
                                at a million. But here all I did was put together a few nice looking
                                prize packs and pushed a button and I blink and suddenly there’s two
                                million there. These are silly and startling times we live in. It’s not
                                merely an age of excitement. It’s an age where dollar figures apparently
                                begin to lose their meaning, and the nature of quantitative reality
                                itself starts to come apart at the seams.</p>
                            <p>But aside from being busy now, there are still a lot of forces to
                                temper the excitement. The biggest elephant in the room for me is
                                finishing Homestuck. It’s going to take a lot of focus to finish it, and
                                getting too deep into game design sounds like the perfect way to derail
                                that. So a lot of my enthusiasm for this game project will have to be
                                deferred until next year. Another factor is the budget. While 2 million
                                is crazy money, and gets regular people to do insane things on TV for
                                it, it is by no means the dream budget when it comes to games. So this
                                isn’t about me waving a magic wand and making anything that’s in my head
                                appear on your computer, which frankly is the proposition that makes
                                the average game enthusiast feel excited when they think about making a
                                game. That budget is actually going to create a lot of tough creative
                                choices. You always want the money you have to be maximized to make the
                                best product, but the question is, how? If you get a little extra money
                                in the budget, do you load it into nicer graphics? A richer gameplay
                                experience? Coming to these conclusions is less about the excitement of
                                creativity and more about making the practical judgments and compromises
                                of a producer. That’ll be what we’re involved with soon after <a
