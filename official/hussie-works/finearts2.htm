          <p>
          <span class="tsomain">I’ve done it again! As an intrepid 
connoisseur of the obscure fine arts, I have ferreted out another 
delicious Junior Mint from beneath the couch cushions of artistic 
anonymity. The name is Chris Sawyer, and the game is immaculately 
rendered, anatomically exquisite male humanoid animals. Sometimes this 
is called “anthro-art”, but I don’t care where you’re from, I call it a 
God damned gift from heaven. 
<br>

<br>
Now please be aware, some of the below images may be very mildly <span style="color: yellow"><span style="font-weight: bold">not safe for work</span></span>.
 But if you ask me, any boss that would frown on his employees viewing 
these masterpieces is not worthy of the privilege of your service. If my
 boss told me to stop looking at this stuff, I’d storm into his office 
and toss the Pink Dildo of Resignation onto his lap. I’d say with a 
sneer, “Yeah, your wife knows all about THAT.” While he ponders to 
himself whether I was implying that he has trouble satisfying his wife, 
or that I’m having an affair with her, I’m already long gone, and 
pulling up a chair to some sweet <span style="font-style: italic">Chris Motherfuckin’ Sawyer art</span>! Let’s have a look.
<br>

<br>
These fellas sure know how to have a good time! Fun, camaraderie, 
friendly spirit, brotherhood, these are all things that simply ooze from
 Sawyer’s pencil. I’m glad this is the first one we’re looking at. It 
will give us all the very apt impression that Sawyer’s work is dominated
 by themes of wholesome, lighthearted fun. Jesus, a blacksmith could 
pound a horseshoe on those buttocks. 
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer01.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
This is a drawing of a caveman fucking a dinosaur. Sawyer thinks of 
everything. Clearly he doesn’t have live references to draw from, so his
 imagination is working overtime, calculating that the tail would be 
convenient for a boost in leverage, and even the type of expression a 
dinosaur hopelessly arrested by lust might make. It was nice of him to 
suspend, I’m sure, his natural disgust with the content long enough to 
broadcast this to us so accurately and lovingly. I have taken it upon 
myself to name this piece “Velocirapture”. 
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer02.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
But to be honest, the inclusion of a real human is abnormal to Sawyer’s 
work. Most feature anthro-on-anthro action, and by “action” I simply 
mean stellar craftsmanship and attention to form and line. Some people 
might have thought “action” means sexual content, and I’d right here, 
right now like to dispel that unfair generalization. Anyway, here is a 
saber tooth tiger-man rogering the living fuck out of a huge T-rex. 
Their faces let us know they share a moment of tender ecstasy, and help 
us feel it too. The gender of the dinosaur is unclear. I suppose it 
conceivably could be a female. Don’t count on it though.
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer03.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
His work is not exclusively dinosaur-themed. Works of other splendid 
anthro specimens are plentiful. Here is a sensational, buff lion man 
with Harry Potter frames. His confidence is charming and infectious. 
You’d need a pick and a piton to climb those mountainous biceps. The 
saucy garter is a nice touch, too.
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer04.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
I blurred out the best part though, and I really don’t want you to miss it. The guy is hung like shirts at a Korean cleaners. <span style="font-style: italic">Very well</span>.
 To reduce suspicion of people who may be glancing over your shoulder, I
 have superimposed the phallus over a picture of famous actress Alfre 
Woodard. Now if anyone’s wondering, you’re not looking at dicks, you’re 
just brushing up on the stars. 
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer05.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
I don’t know how he does it. This nonchalant stallion pumping some 
serious iron with his wang vaulting out of his speedos; it’s simply 
scratching <span style="font-style: italic">that itch</span> for daring, mesmerizing content. You know what I’m talking about.  
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer06.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
And again, for the sake of decency and decorum beyond the call of duty, I
 have overlapped the questionable region with a picture of TV superstar 
Jim Belushi. 
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer07.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
And finally, here is a smorgasbord of the main course: egregious cock. 
Really, why trifle with such superfluous dalliances like content, 
character, composition, etc. It’s just so extraneous when this here is 
the very true, unfiltered essence of Sawyer. Really it’s a puzzle to me 
why so much erotic anthro art out there happens to be gay (oh, and I’ve 
seen A LOT of erotic anthro art). Maybe the logic is, if you’re going to
 embrace some form of sexual aberration, you might as well go all out. 
<br>

<br>
<img src="finearts2_files/sawyer08.jpg" border="0">
<br>

<br>
For your benefit, I’ve merged this penis-palette with a Garfield comic 
strip. It strikes me as actually a considerable improvement to the 
strip, and really has served to deface the material only a little less 
than Jim Davis has personally done through decades of over-marketing.
