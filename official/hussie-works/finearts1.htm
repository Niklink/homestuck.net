          <p>
          <span class="tsomain">I have always been a great patron of the
 arts. My discriminating eye is always sifting through works of 
lesser-known artists, on the lookout for the next rising star. With my 
advanced pedigree in the fine arts, I can differentiate between 
aesthetic jewels fortified with cultural significance, and things that 
look like they were once at home in a hog’s rectum. It is with rapturous
 mirth that I present a precious find, a rare gift from the Muses, an 
artist simply referred to as “T”. His paintings make me want to hang up 
my hat on the Lord of Defeat’s erect cock. Let’s have a look at some of 
his work.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
This masterpiece conveys one of the deepest mythological symbols 
embedded in the human predicament: God sitting on his throne while his 
head explodes. No detail has been spared in this powerful quest for 
fidelity in theological imagery. From the seven sacred bowls of candy 
hoisted in nobility at each flank, to the visible aftermath of one of 
His legendary “wet robe contests”, causing the linens to cling to His 
unbelievable pectorals, much like the faithful cling to His  Word. Note 
the enviable use of gold paint, and the fabled bird-vaporizing 
death-rainbow. I’m not sure which religion this is, but consider me a 
convert. 
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
This one floored me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more daring and 
honest portrayal of some kind of vagina emerging from bubbling marinara 
sauce. The sauce I imagine may represent blood, in classic deep-rooted 
maternal imagery with strong themes of menstruation. The pure white 
wings of the gallant angel is like a righteous maxi-pad making a bold 
stand against the crimson surge. Symbolism aside, “T” demonstrates his 
absolute mastery over human anatomy with the golden-maned, jaw-dropping 
specimen of an angel. He’s so ripped, he’s brought down to one knee by 
the burden of his own muscles. He has to drape his arm over his ally for
 support (his ally being his own mighty, bulging arm). I know I 
personally won’t be satisfied with my workout regimen until I have full,
 well-developed buttocks growing out of my left leg. 
<br>

<br>
You know, I was just thinking the other day that my wall could use a 
painting of an angel warrior fellating a prune monster. I’m sure when 
providing such a rigorous sexual service, it does help to have a 
chiseled six-pack of abs on your back.
<br>

Looking at this one was like getting punched in the nuts by an android. 
Man, this is powerful. Observe the raw energy of that whale, as it 
surfaces, presumably to plead for a swift mercy killing. I’m sure it’s 
undergone a life of hardships we can’t imagine; egregious birth defects,
 innumerable maritime lobotomies. Its eye is glazed over with a deeply 
tragic resignation, a sign of an animal so thoroughly defeated in every 
way. Yet it summons a kernel of bravery for this final gesture, a plea 
from the depths of its soul for some divine lunar force to dispel once 
and for all the mockery of its existence. Its last ounce of strength is 
used to widen its jaw to the limits, and let forth a noise I imagine 
sounds like a baby lamb might sound after being stuck in a tar pit for a
 solid week. Pitiful, yet otherworldly in sorrow, and wholly soul 
puncturing. For good measure, there’s some dude there whose about to get
 crushed by the mammoth, airborne animal. He reaches out as if to say 
“Watch it, you hideous lard! Oh, I am so fucked.”
<br>

And this is my favorite. As great as all the others are, this one makes 
them look like someone stuck some canvases in a port-o-potty and shook 
it. Everything about this is fucking amazing. Oakland Raiders linebacker
 Bill Romanowski fending off a wild, flaming black steed, in a mystical 
snowcapped mountain setting. Jesus Christ, I’m going to need some new 
pants. I don’t know if it’s the concept alone, which itself is obviously
 mind-blowing. Or maybe it’s the curious, vaguely-humanoid musculature 
of the horse. It has a man’s bicep and triceps, and some very 
suspiciously man-like back muscles. (this was, and I’m being totally 
honest, the sole inspiration for <a href="comic.html?comic=humanimals" target="_blank" class="postlink">Humanimals</a>)
 Or maybe it’s the flaming mane, which on closer inspection, doesn’t 
resemble flame so much as synthetic orange puppet hair. This steed is 
either from hell, or has recently escaped Fraggle Rock, and is ready to 
tear the entire NFL a new asshole. But he didn’t count on bumping into 
Bill Romo (understandably, since he was bucking around the middle of the
 damned Himalayas). Ring ring. Hey, steed, it’s the glue factory. They 
have a message for you, on <span style="font-style: italic">line 53</span>. Fuck yes!</span>
