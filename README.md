## 10/25/2020 RELEASE
A static version of the website https://homestuck.net

All assets and files need nothing but a simple html web server to run. Download, drag to your public folder, boom, archive cloned. 

This is released under the MIT license, which means you can do whatever you want with it. I highly recommend saving a copy.

All fan content belongs to the original authors, though it's mostly just links. The torrent contains bigger files, like music and games.
