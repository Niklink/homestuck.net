I was about fifteen
Am                             Em
I was walking the beach
F                                 G
I was a-racing the wave
Am                                Em
It knocked me off my feet


I fell into the tide
It spat me back on the sand
I left without a clue
How lucky I was to land


It's been a long, long time
Since my life was spared
It's been a long, long time
But I'm still not scared

It was the dawn of man
Am                             Em
I held the bone in my hand
F                                 G
I was as hungry as death
Am                                Em
Wandering through the sand


I met a wild boar
My bone came down with a crack
I tasted flesh and blood
And swore I'd never look back


It's been a long, long time
But I had just begun
It's been a long, long time
Out in the African sun


It's been a long, long time
Since I learned that skill
It's been a long, long time
Since my very first kill

If anyone's out there to see what we have done

Can somebody tell me what we are to become?

Our tiny lives

This goodly frame, it does not care if we live or die

It was the month of June
Am                        Em
In Tienanmen Square
F                        G
The tanks were on TV
Am                        Em
But I was not yet there


The guns, they all went "pop"
We heard the screams and shouts
I was brought into this world
As they were taken out


It's been a long, long time
So many people to mourn
It's been a long, long time
Since the day I was born


It's been a long, long time
And yet no time at all
It's been a long, long time
And yet no time at all

Who were they, and next to them, who the hell am I?
