          <p>

          <span class="tsomain">This tutorial covers how to color line 
work in Photoshop the most simplistic way possible. No shading, no fancy
 effects, just flat areas of tone, painted neatly and in the lines. This
 is very basic stuff, and if you have any experience with Photoshop 
coloring at all, this will not blow your mind. My main purpose is to 
have a foundational tutorial before I begin more advanced coloring 
tutorials. This lays the essential groundwork. 

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Scan your line work</span>

<br> 


<br> 
You've penciled something, and presumably inked it. Having it inked 
crisply and neatly will make the coloring that much easier, but this is 
of course not essential. 

<br> 


<br> 
Scan big. Even if you never plan on printing out your art, it's much 
better to work large, and then shrink down your final image. This will 
diminish the imperfections of the work and make it look more crisp 
overall. And you're not caught with your pants down should you ever want
 to print. 

<br> 


<br> 
If you don't plan to print, I'd recommend scanning at least 200 pixels per inch. If you do want to print, at least 300 ppi. 

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut01.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
This is the raw scan of the line work. We'll need some more contrast before we can start.

<br> 


<br> 
Go to Image -&gt; Adjustments- &gt; Levels. (ctrl+L) Move the leftmost 
and rightmost arrows closer to the center. This will make the darks 
darker, and lights lighter. Fiddle with it until you have a nice strong 
contrast, with few discernable tones besides black and white.

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut02.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
The adjusted image. Now we can start coloring. I've documented 3 
different methods for flat coloring. You should read through each 
successively, as there's a progression of logic moving from one to 
another.

<br> 


<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Method 1 (Impractical and ineffective. Almost useless.)</span>

<br> 


<br> 
If you're a beginner, it may be your intuition to reach for the flood 
fill tool (the paint bucket) and start clicking on areas of the line 
work that you want to fill. Ok, we'll try it your way. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut03.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Oops, look at that. I tried to fill his shirt and it spilled over into 
his face. On closer inspection, it turns out there are little gaps in my
 line work. Small enough not to notice, but Photoshop certainly notices.
 Color will escape through the smallest chink in the line. There are 
other problems, too.

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut04.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Zooming in, we notice there are some parts of the line that are grayish,
 or near-white that don't get filled. You could fight this problem by 
increasing the “tolerance” property of the paint bucket. But then 
you'll find the fill color eating into your lines, reducing the 
subtleties of your nice line work. 

<br> 


<br> 
You say “Ok, that's a bust. But surely there must be a shortcut to getting all these areas filled.”

<br> 


<br> 
Fine, we'll try something a little more promising. This time we'll do 
the filling on a layer underneath the line work, so it “shows 
through” the white parts of the layer.

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Setting up your layers</span>

<br> 


<br> 
This process is necessary for all methods I describe. First set your background color to white. Easily done by clicking this:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut05.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Now you want to configure your layers so they look like this:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut06.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Follow these steps to do this:

<br> 
- Select the background layer.

<br> 
- Select All (ctrl+A)

<br> 
- Cut (ctrl+X)

<br> 
- Paste (ctrl+V)

<br> 
- Set to Multiply

<br> 
- Select background layer

<br> 
- Make new layer

<br> 


<br> 
The new layer in between is where you'll be coloring. All colors will show through the white areas of the line work layer.

<br> 


<br> 
First we'll take care of the background color, since it's the easiest 
one, and all other color layers will rest on top of it. It'll help you 
make color choices later, knowing what they look like on top of the 
background color.

<br> 


<br> 
Use the rectangular marquee tool to draw a box. Flood fill it with a color. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut07.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Once you deselect, you can always recall that selection by ctrl + 
clicking that layer's icon. This is an important point, particularly for
 more advanced coloring techniques. When you get into things like 
shading and textures, a big part of the purpose of doing all this flat 
coloring (for me at least) is just to have areas of color on separate 
layers which can be selected and act as masks, for further rendering 
inside the boundaries of the layer shapes. It saves the headache of 
having to focus on drawing inside the lines at every step of the way. 
More on that in another tutorial.

<br> 


<br> 
Anyway, we were going to see if there was a really fast way to get this 
coloring done. We ruled out flood filling the line art directly. But 
maybe we can get some use out of the magic wand. It is supposed to be 
magic, after all.

<br> 


<br> 
Set the properties of the magic wand to this:

<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut08.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Tolerance doesn't have to be 50 exactly. It's just a generous number 
without going over the top. It just means how much the created selection
 will “bleed” into the line comprising the area's perimeter. We're 
dealing with pretty stark black and white, so this isn't a big issue. 

<br> 


<br> 
Now with the line work layer selected, click the area you want to color.

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut09.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Oh yeah, that's right. There are still gaps in the line work, so 
clicking the shirt floods into the face. This is really starting to be a
 pain in the ass, isn't it? Here's what we're going to do. 

<br> 


<br> 
Right-click the linework layer, Duplicate Layer. 

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut10.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut11.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Now we have a copy of the line work to mess with. We're just going to 
take a brush and fill the gaps in any line we want to fully enclose an 
area to be colored. And since this is a duplicate layer, we don't have 
to be too careful about it. We'll just delete it later. 

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut12.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut13.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut14.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
There. Just to show how much trouble this can be, I've highlighted below all the places where I filled gaps.

<br> 


<br> 
<img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut15.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Maybe you're asking: “So why don't you just draw line art without any 
gaps? It seems to me a gap in a line should be considered a sloppy 
mistake anyway.” You're completely wrong. Gaps in lines can be an 
important part of a drawing style. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070821193510/http://www.teamspecialolympics.com/tutorials.php?id=12921" target="_blank" class="postlink">As I've Illustrated before</a>)
 You don't want to sacrifice that just to make coloring easier. And 
besides, gaps are just going to happen, even if it's not a pivotal part 
of your style. And the more complex or advanced the line work gets, the 
more likely they are to occur. Or similar complications will arise, such
 as with certain kinds of feathering or cross hatching. If that's 
involved, then just forget this method. (you should probably forget it 
anyway. I'm only describing it to fully educate you on the benefits of 
an alternative)

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut16.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
So now that there are no more gaps, you can go ahead and magic wand all 
those areas, and fill them one by one on a new layer. (Also delete the 
linework layer copy, to go back to the original quality of your lines) 
Aside from filling in the gaps, we sure saved a lot of time. And it 
looks ok, I guess. Well, not really…

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut17.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Look closer. There are still all these spots that the magic wand missed.
 And there just isn't anything you can do about that, aside from going 
in with a brush and touching up all those spots. And if you're going to 
color with a brush at all, suddenly your pissing away all that time you 
thought you were saving with this shortcut technique. You might as well 
use one of the next two methods, which are just as time consuming, if 
not much less, which yield superior results. 

<br> 


<br> 
The bottom line of all this:

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">There are no shortcuts. Unless your line
 work is consistently and remarkable simple, there is no better or 
faster way to do flat coloring than one of the following two methods. 

<br> 


<br> 


<br> 
Method 2 (Optimal in time and results for probably 90% of cases)</span>

<br> 


<br> 
Let's start over. Some things in method 1 we're going to do again. Like setting up our layers like this:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut06.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
And starting with the first color layer, the background color:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut07.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Easy enough. Now we're going to do something radical: <span style="font-weight: bold">color with a brush using your hand</span>. Holy shit, it's the year 2000!

<br> 


<br> 
Select the brush. Then set a brush size you're comfortable with. Click 
the little button on your stylus (drawing tablet pen. Wacom makes them. I
 am presuming you have one for the sake of this tutorial. You can use a 
mouse too, but obviously it's harder.) You should have your stylus 
button set to function as a mouse right-click. This will activate the 
window below. If you are changing your basic brush settings any other 
way, you are wasting time and energy. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut18.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Now for rocket science. Draw a perimeter in color, on a new layer, while
 staying in the lines of your line work. It helps to zoom in while doing
 this. Keep your other hand over the space bar. When you press it, you 
can move your drawing around on the screen. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut19.html" border="0">

<br> 

 
<br> 
Now we aren't going to color the whole thing in by hand. That would be a
 criminal waste of time. Just use the flood fill tool from here. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut20.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
You can see there's a little halo where the filled area meets the 
perimeter. This is unavoidable. But it's nowhere near as inconvenient to
 fix as when the fill is mingling directly with your line layer, as in 
method one. In fact, just about the easiest step imaginable can fix it:

<br> 


<br> 
Fill it again. That is, with the paint bucket, click the exact same area you just filled. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut21.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Above is an animation of what happens when you fill it again (the line 
layer is hidden to show the effect). The halo vanishes, but the area as a
 whole gets a little bigger. There's no way to avoid that. But it's not 
too inconvenient, most of the time. 

<br> 


<br> 
Here it is with the line work showing:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut22.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
In places where your lines are thinner, or where you colored too close to the edge, the color will “bleed” over just a bit. 

<br> 


<br> 
There are two ways to handle this problem:

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">1: Live with it.</span>

<br> 


<br> 
If you have thick line work, you may not see it at all. Or if you're 
working on a big image (which is recommended anyway) and you shrink down
 quite a bit for final output, the effect may not be visible at all, or 
to a degree that doesn't bother you. Or, you may even kind of like the 
effect, who knows.

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">2: Erase it</span>

<br> 


<br> 
If you hate it, you can obviously erase any excess. Shouldn't take long 
in most cases. Or, if it looks like it will take long, and it's 
intolerable to you, you can use method 3.

<br> 


<br> 
Here is the finished version using this method.

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut23.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
I've put each major colored area on it's own layer, and labeled them appropriately:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut24.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
I highly recommend this if you want to move on to more advanced 
techniques from here. (If not, then stick ‘em on one layer if you 
want. Doesn't really matter) These will serve as highly value areas for 
masking, and drawing on top of without having to worry about staying in 
the lines again. In fact, it doesn't even matter what colors I chose 
here. If I don't like them in the end, I can go back and change any of 
them, by clicking on a layer and tweaking the color qualities (ctrl + 
U), or masking them (ctrl + click layer icon) and filling with another 
color on a layer above. From an advanced perspective, flat coloring is 
purely grunt-work, and the only objective is to get all the needed 
well-defined maskable areas on their own layers, for further tweaking 
later. 

<br> 


<br> 
Some things to note: I didn't go nuts. I put small things all on one 
layer called misc, like the mouth, smoke, star, etc. If you find 
yourself with too many layers, and feel it can be consolidated a bit, 
ctrl + E (merge layer) is good to know. It combines the selected layer 
with the one underneath, into one layer. Another thing: Notice how I 
started with the shirt/hat layer, then did the skin. When I made the 
skin layer, I put it underneath. That way I have no chance of drawing on
 top of work I've already done that I don't want to disturb. I already 
got the hat brim and collar line right, why would I want to do it again?
 Just a time-saving trick. You may find your own as you go.

<br> 


<br> 
But back to the issue of “bleeding”, and how to handle it. It becomes a moot point with method 3.

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Method 3: (Works well for 100% of coloring tasks, for just a little more time spent)</span>

<br> 


<br> 
This is identical to method 2, up until this stage:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut20.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Instead of clicking it again with the paint bucket to erase the halo, we will get rid of it like this:

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut25.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut26.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Yep, just draw over it with the brush. Very easy. Personally, I mix it up, using methods 2 and 3 almost equally. 

<br> 


<br> 
That's just about all you need to know on flat color. Although I will 
touch on one more idea, for your benefit. A process I described earlier 
reminded me that it was a link in a chain comprising another useful 
task. It was a…

<br> 


<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold">Stroke of Genius</span>

<br> 


<br> 
Sometimes a nice graphic trick is to put a colored stroke around the 
line work. It can help separate the drawing from a background that's too
 dark or busy, emphasize the line work, or add n element of dynamism. 
I'm not promoting the abuse of this trick. If you do it too much, it'll 
get old. But it's nice to know how.

<br> 


<br> 
Start with the process I described early in method 1, i.e. duplicating the line layer. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut10.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut11.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Then close all the gaps with the brush. (highlighted here. Don't actually draw yellow on the damn thing, you fool)

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut15.jpg" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
This seals the perimeter, so we can make a good selection using the magic wand. Make sure the linework copy layer is selected. 

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut27.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
Take the magic wand and select the parts outside of the line work. Hold 
in shift while you make selections, so you can keep adding to the whole 
selection. Don't forget any bit of negative space, like that tricky 
little spot between the smoke and hat. 

<br> 


<br> 
Then invert the selection. Select -&gt; Inverse (ctrl + shift + I). Now pick a color you want the stroke to be. 

<br> 


<br> 
Create a new layer for the stroke, just above the background color (layer p2).

<br> 


<br> 
 <img src="Team%20Special%20Olympics%20flat%20coloring_files/flatctut28.html" border="0">

<br> 


<br> 
There are a couple different ways to proceed from here. I'll describe both and let you choose.

<br> 
- Click the Paths tab (usually grouped with the Layers window. If not, Windows -&gt; Paths.)

<br> 
- Turn the selection into a path (see image below)

<br> 
- Click the brush, set the brush thickness to be the thickness you want 
for the stroke. You may have to do this a few times to get what you 
want. 

<br> 
- Hit Enter.

The stroke appears automatically. Notice a lot more was stroked than you
 probably wanted (even the little specks from the line art). You'll have
 to clean this up.

- Got to Select -&gt; Modify -&gt; Expand. Type in the width you want the stroke to be. 

<br> 
- Just flood fill the selection on the new layer.

This way is just a little simpler, I think. But it amplifies the noise 
of the line work more. You can see there are a lot more little “stroke
 ghosts” to clean up. And because no path had to be created with 
curious math algorithms, the stroke runs a little truer to the 
perimeter. This is the method I use more often. 

<br> 


<br> 
To clean up, you can just erase anything you don't want. Although I do 
have a faster method. Just erase any part that is directly touching the 
stroke (as you'd like to see it). Once it's separate from all the stuff 
you don't want, use the wand to select the wanted stroke area. Then 
invert selection (ctrl + shift + I), hit delete. Gone.

<br> 


<br> 
Here it is cleaned up.

Because it's on its own layer, I can easily change the stroke color if I want, too.</span>
