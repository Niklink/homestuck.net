The Shipping Game
=================
(this was original posted to MSPAForums 2011-04-25 by Armada, but
the Android app was lost.)

This game was inspired by a Japanese game know as the King's Game (or
Ousama).  Here's how you play: Take a chopstick for each player, write
"Osama" on one of them, and number the others from 1 upwards. Then
someone holds the chopsticks in their fist, so the numbers are concealed,
and everybody draws a stick, without telling anyone their number. The
lucky guy or gal with the "Osama" chopstick gets to be the King. The
Osama decides on a task and then states the numbers of the players
who must perform it, (without knowing who they are). For example:
"number two must kiss number five!" or "number three has to do
the Macarena!" or "numbers seven and eight must down their drinks!"
This inevitably leads to a succession of pant-pissingly funny antics
(as long as you're not the person performing the embarrassing acts.)

After each deed is done, the chopsticks are gathered again, and the
process is repeated. Usually everybody gets a chance to be the King,
and players relish the chance to exact revenge on those who tormented
them in previous rounds of the game.

So with the two weeks I had between Tekkoshocon and the Pittsburghstuck
meetup, I came up with a "shipping" styled version of this with a
Homestuck theme. "Cards" were used instead of just "free" commands so
that there would four distinct quardants, but this could easily be played
the original way.

How To Play:
-----
To start, get a random way to select everyone's number and the
Shipper (basically the king from the original game with a different
name. They give the orders). Use cards, draw straws, use a random
number generator. Anything will work pretty much. Just make sure you
have something directly designated for the shipper (it could be the
highest number or the letter S).

Randomly assign a number to everyone (draw you straws or cards). DON'T
TELL ANYONE WHAT YOU GOT UNLESS YOU ARE THE SHIPPER.

The shipper draws a card from the pile. In the Android app, press the
menu button and press new card. If you're using your own physical cards,
just pick one off the top. If you feel like freestyling, go ahead and
make something up. The shipper replaces X, Y, and Z on the card with
numbers. The numbers then do whatever that card said. (The shipper
places the card on the bottom of the pile if you are playing with
physical cards.)

Gather up you cards or straws or whatever from the players. Randomize
again and repeat the whole process. Now you're cooking with gas!

Example of play
-----
8 players are playing. They have 8 playing cards, 1 through 7 and
a king card, to assign numbers. The cards are shuffled and everyone
picks one. Nepeta is the shipper. Nepeta draws a new card that reads:
"X and Y have a hate filled rap-off". She chooses numbers 1 and 5. John
and Karkat are those numbers, and they proceed to have the shittiest
rap-off in the history of love raps. Everyone has a good laugh!

These are the 104 cards that were used in the game; one could use
a double-deck of playing cards, 26 of each suit.
